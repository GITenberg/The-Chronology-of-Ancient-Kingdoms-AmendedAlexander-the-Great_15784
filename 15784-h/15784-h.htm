<h3>TO THE</h3>

<h1>QUEEN.</h1>

  <p>MADAM,</p>

  <p><i>As I could never hope to write any thing my self, worthy to be laid
  before YOUR MAJESTY; I think it a very great happiness, that it should be
  my lot to usher into the world, under Your Sacred Name, the last work of
  as great a Genius as any Age ever produced: an Offering of such value in
  its self, as to be in no danger of suffering from the meanness of the
  hand that presents it.</i></p>

  <p><i>The impartial and universal encouragement which YOUR MAJESTY has
  always given to Arts and Sciences, entitles You to the best returns the
  learned world is able to make: And the many extraordinary Honours YOUR
  MAJESTY vouchsafed the Author of the following sheets, give You a just
  right to his Productions. These, above the rest, lay the most particular
  claim to Your Royal Protection; For the </i>Chronology<i> had never
  appeared in its present Form without YOUR MAJESTY's Influence; and the
  </i>Short Chronicle<i>, which precedes it, is entirely owing to the
  Commands with which You were pleased to honour him, out of your singular
  Care for the education of the Royal Issue, and earnest desire to form
  their minds betimes, and lead them early into the knowledge of
  Truth.</i></p>

  <p><i>The Author has himself acquainted the Publick, that the following
  Treatise was the fruit of his vacant hours, and the relief he sometimes
  had recourse to, when tired with his other studies. What an Idea does it
  raise of His abilities, to find that a Work of such labour and learning,
  as would have been a sufficient employment and glory for the whole life
  of another, was to him diversion only, and amusement! The Subject is in
  its nature incapable of that demonstration upon which his other writings
  are founded, but his usual accuracy and judiciousness are here no less
  observable; And at the same time that he supports his suggestions, with
  all the authorities and proofs that the whole compass of Science can
  furnish, he offers them with the greatest caution; And by a Modesty, that
  was natural to Him and always accompanies such superior talents, sets a
  becoming example to others, not to be too presumptuous in matters so
  remote and dark. Tho' the Subject be only </i>Chronology<i>, yet, as the
  mind of the Author abounded with the most extensive variety of Knowledge,
  he frequently intersperses Observations of a different kind; and
  occasionally instills principles of Virtue and Humanity, which seem to
  have been always uppermost in his heart, and, as they were the Constant
  Rule of his actions, appear Remarkably in all his writings.</i></p>

  <p><i>Here YOUR MAJESTY will see </i>Astronomy<i>, and a just Observation
  on the course of Nature, assisting other parts of Learning to illustrate
  Antiquity; and a Penetration and Sagacity peculiar to the great Author,
  dispelling that Mist, with which Fable and Error had darkened it; and
  will with pleasure contemplate the first dawnings of Your favourite Arts
  and Sciences, the noblest and most beneficial of which He alone carried
  farther in a few years, than all the most Learned who went before him,
  had been able to do in many Ages. Here too, MADAM, You will observe, that
  an Abhorrence of Idolatry and Persecution (the very essence and
  foundation of that Religion, which makes so bright a part of YOUR
  MAJESTY's character) was one of the </i>earliest Laws<i> of the Divine
  Legislator, the </i>Morality of the first Ages, and the primitive
  Religion of both Jews and Christians<i>; and, as the Author adds,
  </i>ought to be the standing Religion of all Nations; it being for the
  honour of God, and good of Mankind<i>. Nor will YOUR MAJESTY be
  displeased to find his sentiments so agreeable to Your own, whilst he
  condemns </i>all oppression<i>; and every kind of </i>cruelty, even to
  brute beasts<i>; and, with so much warmth, inculcates </i>Mercy<i>,
  </i>Charity<i>, and the indispensable duty of </i>doing good<i>, and
  promoting the general </i>welfare of mankind<i>: Those great ends, for
  which Government was first instituted, and to which alone it is
  administred in this happy Nation, under a KING, who distinguished himself
  early in opposition to the Tyranny which threatned </i>Europe<i>, and
  chuses to reign in the hearts of his subjects; Who, by his innate
  Benevolence, and Paternal Affection to his People, establishes and
  confirms all their Liberties; and, by his Valour and Magnanimity, guards
  and defends them.</i></p>

  <p><i>That Sincerity and Openness of mind, which is the darling quality
  of this Nation, is become more conspicuous, by being placed upon the
  Throne; And we see, with Pride, OUR SOVEREIGN the most eminent for a
  Virtue, by which our country is so desirous to be distinguished. A
  Prince, whose views and heart are above all the mean arts of Disguise, is
  far out of the reach of any temptation to Introduce Blindness and
  Ignorance. And, as HIS MAJESTY is, by his incessant personal cares,
  dispensing Happiness at home, and Peace abroad; You, MADAM, lead us on by
  Your great Example to the most noble use of that Quiet and Ease, which we
  enjoy under His Administration, whilst all Your hours of leisure are
  employed in cultivating in Your Self That Learning, which You so warmly
  patronize in Others.</i></p>

  <p><i>YOUR MAJESTY does not think the instructive Pursuit, an
  entertainment below Your exalted Station; and are Your Self a proof, that
  the abstruser parts of it are not beyond the reach of Your Sex. Nor does
  this Study end in barren speculation; It discovers itself in a steady
  attachment to true Religion; in Liberality, Beneficence, and all those
  amiable Virtues, which increase and heighten the Felicities of a Throne,
  at the same time that they bless All around it. Thus, MADAM, to enjoy,
  together with the highest state of publick Splendor and Dignity all the
  retired Pleasures and domestick Blessings of private life; is the
  perfection of human Wisdom, as well as Happiness.</i></p>

  <p><i>The good Effects of this Love of knowledge, will not stop with the
  present Age; It will diffuse its Influence with advantage to late
  Posterity: And what may we not anticipate in our minds for the
  Generations to come under a Royal Progeny, so descended, so educated, and
  formed by such Patterns!</i></p>

  <p><i>The glorious Prospect gives us abundant reason to hope, that
  Liberty and Learning will be perpetuated together; and that the bright
  Examples of Virtue and Wisdom, set in this Reign by the Royal Patrons of
  Both, will be transmitted with the Scepter to their Posterity, till this
  and the other Works of Sir ISAAC NEWTON shall be forgot, and Time it self
  be no more: Which is the most sincere and ardent wish of</i></p>

<h3><i>MADAM,</i></h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">May it please YOUR MAJESTY,</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">YOUR MAJESTY's most obedient and most dutiful subject and servant,</p>

<h2>Advertisement.</h2>

  <p><i>Tho' </i>The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms amended<i>, was writ by
  the Author many years since; yet he lately revis'd it, and was actually
  preparing it for the Press at the time of his death. But </i>The Short
  Chronicle<i> was never intended to be made public, and therefore was not
  so lately corrected by him. To this the Reader must impute it, if he
  shall find any places where </i>the Short Chronicle<i> does not
  accurately agree with the Dates assigned in the larger Piece. The Sixth
  Chapter was not copied out with the other Five, which makes it doubtful
  whether he intended to print it: but being found among his Papers, and
  evidently appearing to be a Continuation of the same Work, and (as such)
  abridg'd in </i>the Short Chronicle<i>; it was thought proper to be
  added.</i></p>

  <p><i>Had the </i>Great Author<i> himself liv'd to publish this Work,
  there would have been no occasion for this Advertisement; But as it is,
  the Reader is desired to allow for such imperfections as are inseparable
  from Posthumous Pieces; and, in so great a number of proper names, to
  excuse some errors of the Press that have escaped.</i></p>

<h3>A SHORT</h3>

<h2>CHRONICLE</h2>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">FROM THE<br />
First Memory of Things in <i>Europe</i>,<br />
TO THE<br />
Conquest of <i>Persia</i> by <i>Alexander</i> the Great.</p>

  <br clear="all" />
<hr />

<h3>The INTRODUCTION.</h3>

  <p>The <i>Greek</i> Antiquities are full of Poetical Fictions, because
  the <i>Greeks</i> wrote nothing in Prose, before the Conquest of
  <i>Asia</i> by <i>Cyrus</i> the <i>Persian</i>. Then <i>Pherecydes
  Scyrius</i> and <i>Cadmus Milesius</i> introduced the writing in Prose.
  <i>Pherecydes Atheniensis</i>, about the end of the Reign of <i>Darius
  Hystaspis</i>, wrote of Antiquities, and digested his work by
  Genealogies, and was reckoned one of the best Genealogers.
  <i>Epimenides</i> the Historian proceeded also by Genealogies; and
  <i>Hellanicus</i>, who was twelve years older than <i>Herodotus</i>,
  digested his History by the Ages or Successions of the Priestesses of
  <i>Juno Argiva</i>. Others digested theirs by the Kings of the
  <i>Lacedæmonians</i>, or Archons of <i>Athens</i>. <i>Hippias</i> the
  <i>Elean</i>, about thirty years before the fall of the <i>Persian</i>
  Empire, published a breviary or list of the Olympic Victors; and about
  ten years before the fall thereof, <i>Ephorus</i> the disciple of
  <i>Isocrates</i> formed a Chronological History of <i>Greece</i>,
  beginning with the return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>, and ending with the siege of <i>Perinthus</i>, in
  the twentieth year of <i>Philip</i> the father of <i>Alexander</i> the
  great: But he digested things by Generations, and the reckoning by
  Olympiads was not yet in use, nor doth it appear that the Reigns of Kings
  were yet set down by numbers of years. The <i>Arundelian</i> marbles were
  composed sixty years after the death of <i>Alexander</i> the great
  (<i>An.</i> 4. <i>Olymp.</i> 128.) and yet mention not the Olympiads: But
  in the next Olympiad, <i>Timæus Siculus</i> published an history in
  several books down to his own times, according to the Olympiads,
  comparing the Ephori, the Kings of <i>Sparta</i>, the Archons of
  <i>Athens</i>, and the Priestesses of <i>Argos</i>, with the Olympic
  Victors, so as to make the Olympiads, and the Genealogies and Successions
  of Kings, Archons, and Priestesses, and poetical histories suit with one
  another, according to the best of his judgment. And where he left off,
  <i>Polybius</i> began and carried on the history.</p>

  <p>So then a little after the death of <i>Alexander</i> the great, they
  began to set down the Generations, Reigns and Successions, in numbers of
  years, and by putting Reigns and Successions equipollent to Generations,
  and three Generations to an hundred or an hundred and twenty years (as
  appears by their Chronology) they have made the Antiquities of
  <i>Greece</i> three or four hundred years older than the truth. And this
  was the original of the Technical Chronology of the <i>Greeks</i>.
  <i>Eratosthenes</i> wrote about an hundred years after the death of
  <i>Alexander</i> the great: He was followed by <i>Apollodorus</i>, and
  these two have been followed ever since by Chronologers.</p>

  <p>But how uncertain their Chronology is, and how doubtful it was reputed
  by the <i>Greeks</i> of those times, may be understood by these passages
  of <i>Plutarch</i>. <i>Some reckon</i>, saith he, <a name="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Lycurgus <i>contemporary to
  </i>Iphitus<i>, and to have been his companion in ordering the Olympic
  festivals: amongst whom was </i>Aristotle<i> the Philosopher, arguing
  from the Olympic Disc, which had the name of </i> <i> </i>Lycurgus<i>
  upon it. Others supputing the times by the succession of the Kings of the
  </i>Lacedæmonians<i>, as </i>Eratosthenes<i> and </i>Apollodorus<i>,
  affirm that he was not a few years older than the first Olympiad.</i>
  First <i>Aristotle</i> and some others made him as old as the first
  Olympiad; then <i>Eratosthenes</i>, <i>Apollodorus</i>, and some others
  made him above an hundred years older: and in another place
  <i>Plutarch</i> <a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> tells us:
  <i>The congress of </i>Solon<i> with </i>Croesus<i>, some think they can
  confute by Chronology. But an history so illustrious, and verified by so
  many witnesses, and (which is more) so agreeable to the manners of
  </i>Solon<i>, and so worthy of the greatness of his mind and of his
  wisdom, I cannot persuade my self to reject because of some Chronological
  Canons, as they call them: which hundreds of authors correcting, have not
  yet been able to constitute any thing certain, in which they could agree
  among themselves, about repugnancies</i>. It seems the Chronologers had
  made the Legislature of <i>Solon</i> too ancient to consist with that
  Congress.</p>

  <p>For reconciling such repugnancies, Chronologers have sometimes doubled
  the persons of men. So when the Poets had changed <i>Io</i> the daughter
  of <i>Inachus</i> into the <i>Egyptian Isis</i>, Chronologers made her
  husband <i>Osiris</i> or <i>Bacchus</i> and his mistress <i>Ariadne</i>
  as old as <i>Io</i>, and so feigned that there were two <i>Ariadnes</i>,
  one the mistress of <i>Bacchus</i>, and the other the mistress of
  <i>Theseus</i>, and two <i>Minos's</i> their fathers, and a younger
  <i>Io</i> the daughter of <i>Jasus</i>, writing <i>Jasus</i> corruptly
  for <i>Inachus</i>. And so they have made two <i>Pandions</i>, and two
  <i>Erechtheus's</i>, giving the name of <i>Erechthonius</i> to the first;
  <i>Homer</i> calls the first, <i>Erechtheus</i>: and by such corruptions
  they have exceedingly perplexed Ancient History.</p>

  <p>And as for the Chronology of the <i>Latines</i>, that is still more
  uncertain. <i>Plutarch</i> represents great uncertainties in the
  Originals of <i>Rome</i>: and so doth <i>Servius</i>. The old records of
  the <i>Latines</i> were burnt by the <i>Gauls</i>, sixty and four years
  before the death of <i>Alexander</i> the great; and <i>Quintus Fabius
  Pictor</i>, the oldest historian of the <i>Latines</i>, lived an hundred
  years later than that King.</p>

  <p>In Sacred History, the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire began with <i>Pul</i>
  and <i>Tiglathpilaser</i>, and lasted about 170 years. And accordingly
  <i>Herodotus</i> hath made <i>Semiramis</i> only five generations, or
  about 166 years older than <i>Nitocris</i>, the mother of the last King
  of <i>Babylon</i>. But <i>Ctesias</i> hath made <i>Semiramis</i> 1500
  years older than <i>Nitocris</i>, and feigned a long series of Kings of
  <i>Assyria</i>, whose names are not <i>Assyrian</i>, nor have any
  affinity with the <i>Assyrian</i> names in Scripture.</p>

  <p>The Priests of <i>Egypt</i> told <i>Herodotus</i>, that <i>Menes</i>
  built <i>Memphis</i> and the sumptuous temple of <i>Vulcan</i>, in that
  City: and that <i>Rhampsinitus</i>, <i>M&#339;ris</i>, <i>Asychis</i> and
  <i>Psammiticus</i> added magnificent porticos to that temple. And it is
  not likely that <i>Memphis</i> could be famous, before <i>Homer</i>'s
  days who doth not mention it, or that a temple could be above two or
  three hundred years in building. The Reign of <i>Psammiticus</i> began
  about 655 years before Christ, and I place the founding of this temple by
  <i>Menes</i> about 257 years earlier: but the Priests of <i>Egypt</i> had
  so magnified their Antiquities before the days of <i>Herodotus</i>, as to
  tell him that from <i>Menes</i> to <i>M&#339;ris</i> (who reigned 200
  years before <i>Psammiticus</i>) there were 330 Kings, whose Reigns took
  up as many Ages, that is eleven thousand years, and had filled up the
  interval with feigned Kings, who had done nothing. And before the days of
  <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> they had raised their Antiquities so much higher,
  as to place six, eight, or ten new Reigns of Kings between those Kings,
  whom they had represented to <i>Herodotus</i> to succeed one another
  immediately.</p>

  <p>In the Kingdom of <i>Sicyon</i>, Chronologers have split <i>Apis
  Epaphus</i> or <i>Epopeus</i> into two Kings, whom they call <i>Apis</i>
  and <i>Epopeus</i>, and between them have inserted eleven or twelve
  feigned names of Kings who did nothing, and thereby they have made its
  Founder <i>Ægialeus</i>, three hundred years older than his brother
  <i>Phoroneus</i>. Some have made the Kings of <i>Germany</i> as old as
  the Flood: and yet before the use of letters, the names and actions of
  men could scarce be remembred above eighty or an hundred years after
  their deaths: and therefore I admit no Chronology of things done in
  <i>Europe</i>, above eighty years before <i>Cadmus</i> brought letters
  into <i>Europe</i>; none, of things done in <i>Germany</i>, before the
  rise of the <i>Roman</i> Empire.</p>

  <p>Now since <i>Eratosthenes</i> and <i>Apollodorus</i> computed the
  times by the Reigns of the Kings of <i>Sparta</i>, and (as appears by
  their Chronology still followed) have made the seventeen Reigns of these
  Kings in both Races, between the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i> and the Battel of <i>Thermopylæ</i>, take up
  <i>622</i> years, which is after the rate of 36½ years to a Reign, and
  yet a Race of seventeen Kings of that length is no where to be met with
  in all true History, and Kings at a moderate reckoning Reign but 18 or 20
  years a-piece one with another: I have stated the time of the return of
  the <i>Heraclides</i> by the last way of reckoning, placing it about 340
  years before the Battel of <i>Thermopylæ</i>. And making the Taking of
  <i>Troy</i> eighty years older than that Return, according to
  <i>Thucydides</i>, and the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition a Generation
  older than the <i>Trojan</i> War, and the Wars of <i>Sesostris</i> in
  <i>Thrace</i> and death of <i>Ino</i> the daughter of <i>Cadmus</i> a
  Generation older than that Expedition: I have drawn up the following
  Chronological Table, so as to make Chronology suit with the Course of
  Nature, with Astronomy, with Sacred History, with <i>Herodotus</i> the
  Father of History, and with it self; without the many repugnancies
  complained of by <i>Plutarch</i>. I do not pretend to be exact to a year:
  there may be Errors of five or ten years, and sometimes twenty, and not
  much above.</p>

<h2>CHRONICLE</h2>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">FROM THE<br />
<i>First Memory of things in </i>Europe<i> to<br />
the Conquest of </i>Persia<i> by </i>Alexander<i><br />
the great.</i></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>The Times are set down in years before Christ.</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Canaanites</i> who fled from <i>Joshua</i>, retired in great
  numbers into <i>Egypt</i>, and there conquered <i>Timaus</i>,
  <i>Thamus</i>, or <i>Thammuz</i> King of the lower <i>Egypt</i>, and
  reigned there under their Kings <i>Salatis</i>, <i>B&#339;on</i>,
  <i>Apachnas</i>, <i>Apophis</i>, <i>Janias</i>, <i>Assis</i>, &amp;c.
  untill the days of <i>Eli</i> and <i>Samuel</i>. They fed on flesh, and
  sacrificed men after the manner of the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>, and were
  called Shepherds by the <i>Egyptians</i>, who lived only on the fruits of
  the earth, and abominated flesh-eaters. The upper parts of <i>Egypt</i>
  were in those days under many Kings, Reigning at <i>Coptos</i>,
  <i>Thebes</i>, <i>This</i>, <i>Elephantis</i>, and other Places, which by
  conquering one another grew by degrees into one Kingdom, over which
  <i>Misphragmuthosis</i> Reigned in the days of <i>Eli</i>.</p>

  <p>In the year before Christ 1125 <i>Mephres</i> Reigned over the upper
  <i>Egypt</i> from <i>Syene</i> to <i>Heliopolis</i>, and his Successor
  <i>Misphragmuthosis</i> made a lasting war upon the Shepherds soon after,
  and caused many of them to fly into <i>Palestine</i>, <i>Idumæa</i>,
  <i>Syria</i>, and <i>Libya</i>; and under <i>Lelex</i>, <i>Æzeus</i>,
  <i>Inachus</i>, <i>Pelasgus</i>, <i>Æolus</i> the first, <i>Cecrops</i>,
  and other Captains, into <i>Greece</i>. Before those days <i>Greece</i>
  and all <i>Europe</i> was peopled by wandring <i>Cimmerians</i>, and
  <i>Scythians</i> from the backside of the <i>Euxine Sea</i>, who lived a
  rambling wild sort of life, like the <i>Tartars</i> in the northern parts
  of <i>Asia</i>. Of their Race was <i>Ogyges</i>, in whose days these
  <i>Egyptian</i> strangers came into <i>Greece</i>. The rest of the
  Shepherds were shut up by <i>Misphragmuthosis</i>, in a part of the lower
  <i>Egypt</i> called <i>Abaris</i> or <i>Pelusium</i>.</p>

  <p>In the year 1100 the <i>Philistims</i>, strengthned by the access of
  the Shepherds, conquer <i>Israel</i>, and take the Ark. <i>Samuel</i>
  judges <i>Israel</i>.</p>

  <p>1085. <i>Hæmon</i> the son of <i>Pelasgus</i> Reigns in
  <i>Thessaly</i>.</p>

  <p>1080. <i>Lycaon</i> the son of <i>Pelasgus</i> builds <i>Lycosura</i>;
  <i>Phoroneus</i> the son of <i>Inachus</i>, <i>Phoronicum</i>, afterwards
  called <i>Argos</i>; <i>Ægialeus</i> the brother of <i>Phoroneus</i> and
  son of <i>Inachus</i>, <i>Ægialeum</i>, afterwards called <i>Sicyon</i>:
  and these were the oldest towns in <i>Peloponnesus</i>. 'Till then they
  built only single houses scattered up and down in the fields. About the
  same time <i>Cecrops</i> built <i>Cecropia</i> in <i>Attica</i>,
  afterwards called <i>Athens</i>; and <i>Eleusine</i>, the son of
  <i>Ogyges</i>, built <i>Eleusis</i>. And these towns gave a beginning to
  the Kingdoms of the <i>Arcadians</i>, <i>Argives</i>, <i>Sicyons</i>,
  <i>Athenians</i>, <i>Eleusinians</i>, &amp;c. <i>Deucalion</i>
  flourishes.</p>

  <p>1070. <i>Amosis</i>, or <i>Tethmosis</i>, the successor of
  <i>Misphragmuthosis</i>, abolishes the <i>Ph&#339;nician</i> custom in
  <i>Heliopolis</i> of sacrificing men, and drives the Shepherds out of
  <i>Abaris</i>. By their access the <i>Philistims</i> become so numerous,
  as to bring into the field against <i>Saul</i> 30000 chariots, 6000
  horsemen, and people as the sand on the sea shore for multitude.
  <i>Abas</i>, the father of <i>Acrisius</i> and <i>Pr&#339;tus</i>, comes
  from <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

  <p>1069. <i>Saul</i> is made King of <i>Israel</i>, and by the hand of
  <i>Jonathan</i> gets a great victory over the <i>Philistims</i>.
  <i>Eurotas</i> the son of <i>Lelex</i>, and <i>Lacedæmon</i> who married
  <i>Sparta</i> the daughter of <i>Eurotas</i>, Reign in <i>Laconia</i>,
  and build <i>Sparta</i>.</p>

  <p>1060. <i>Samuel</i> dies.</p>

  <p>1059. <i>David</i> made King.</p>

  <p>1048. The <i>Edomites</i> are conquered and dispersed by <i>David</i>,
  and some of them fly into <i>Egypt</i> with their young King
  <i>Hadad</i>. Others fly to the <i>Persian Gulph</i> with their Commander
  <i>Oannes</i>; and others from the <i>Red Sea</i> to the coast of the
  <i>Mediterranean</i>, and fortify <i>Azoth</i> against <i>David</i>, and
  take <i>Zidon</i>; and the <i>Zidonians</i> who fled from them build
  <i>Tyre</i> and <i>Aradus</i>, and make <i>Abibalus</i> King of
  <i>Tyre</i>. These <i>Edomites</i> carry to all places their Arts and
  Sciences; amongst which were their Navigation, Astronomy, and Letters;
  for in <i>Idumæa</i> they had Constellations and Letters before the days
  of <i>Job</i>, who mentions them: and there <i>Moses</i> learnt to write
  the Law in a book. These <i>Edomites</i> who fled to the
  <i>Mediterranean</i>, translating the word <i>Erythræa</i> into that of
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, give the name of <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> to
  themselves, and that of <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> to all the sea-coasts of
  <i>Palestine</i> from <i>Azoth</i> to <i>Zidon</i>. And hence came the
  tradition of the <i>Persians</i>, and of the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>
  themselves, mentioned by <i>Herodotus</i>, that the
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> came originally from the <i>Red Sea</i>, and
  presently undertook long voyages on the <i>Mediterranean</i>.</p>

  <p>1047. <i>Acrisius</i> marries <i>Eurydice</i>, the daughter of
  <i>Lacedæmon</i> and <i>Sparta</i>. The <i>Ph&#339;nician</i> mariners
  who fled from the <i>Red Sea</i>, being used to long voyages for the sake
  of traffic, begin the like voyages on the <i>Mediterranean</i> from
  <i>Zidon</i>; and sailing as far as <i>Greece</i>, carry away <i>Io</i>
  the daughter of <i>Inachus</i>, who with other <i>Grecian</i> women came
  to their ships to buy their merchandize. The <i>Greek Seas</i> begin to
  be infested with Pyrates.</p>

  <p>1046. The <i>Syrians</i> of <i>Zobah</i> and <i>Damascus</i> are
  conquered by <i>David</i>. <i>Nyctimus</i>, the son of <i>Lycaon</i>,
  reigns in <i>Arcadia</i>. <i>Deucalion</i> still alive.</p>

  <p>1045. Many of the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> and <i>Syrians</i> fleeing
  from <i>Zidon</i> and from <i>David</i>, come under the conduct of
  <i>Cadmus</i>, <i>Cilix</i>, <i>Ph&#339;nix</i>, <i>Membliarius</i>,
  <i>Nycteus</i>, <i>Thasus</i>, <i>Atymnus</i>, and other Captains, into
  <i>Asia minor</i>, <i>Crete</i>, <i>Greece</i>, and <i>Libya</i>; and
  introduce Letters, Music, Poetry, the <i>Octaeteris</i>, Metals and their
  Fabrication, and other Arts, Sciences and Customs of the
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>. At this time <i>Cranaus</i> the successor of
  <i>Cecrops</i> Reigned in <i>Attica</i>, and in his Reign and the
  beginning of the Reign of <i>Nyctimus</i>, the <i>Greeks</i> place the
  flood of <i>Deucalion</i>. This flood was succeeded by four Ages or
  Generations of men, in the first of which <i>Chiron</i> the son of
  <i>Saturn</i> and <i>Philyra</i> was born, and the last of which
  according to <i>Hesiod</i> ended with the <i>Trojan</i> War; and so
  places the Destruction of <i>Troy</i> four Generations or about 140 years
  later than that flood, and the coming of <i>Cadmus</i>, reckoning with
  the ancients three Generations to an hundred years. With these
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> came a sort of men skilled in the Religious
  Mysteries, Arts, and Sciences of <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, and settled in
  several places under the names of <i>Curetes</i>, <i>Corybantes</i>,
  <i>Telchines</i>, and <i>Idæi Dactyli</i>.</p>

  <p>1043. Hellen, the son of <i>Deucalion</i>, and father of <i>Æolus</i>,
  <i>Xuthus</i>, and <i>Dorus</i>, flourishes.</p>

  <p>1035. <i>Erectheus</i> Reigns in <i>Attica</i>. <i>Æthlius</i>, the
  grandson of <i>Deucalion</i> and father of <i>Endymion</i>, builds
  <i>Elis</i>. The <i>Idæi Dactyli</i> find out Iron in mount <i>Ida</i> in
  <i>Crete</i>, and work it into armour and iron tools, and thereby give a
  beginning to the trades of smiths and armourers in <i>Europe</i>; and by
  singing and dancing in their armour, and keeping time by striking upon
  one another's armour with their swords, they bring in Music and Poetry;
  and at the same time they nurse up the <i>Cretan Jupiter</i> in a cave of
  the same mountain, dancing about him in their armour.</p>

  <p>1034. <i>Ammon</i> Reigns in <i>Egypt</i>. He conquered <i>Libya</i>,
  and reduced that people from a wandering savage life to a civil one, and
  taught them to lay up the fruits of the earth; and from him <i>Libya</i>
  and the desert above it were anciently called <i>Ammonia</i>. He was the
  first that built long and tall ships with sails, and had a fleet of such
  ships on the <i>Red Sea</i>, and another on the <i>Mediterranean</i> at
  <i>Irasa</i> in <i>Libya</i>. 'Till then they used small and round
  vessels of burden, invented on the <i>Red Sea</i>, and kept within sight
  of the shore. For enabling them to cross the seas without seeing the
  shore, the <i>Egyptians</i> began in his days to observe the Stars: and
  from this beginning Astronomy and Sailing had their rise. Hitherto the
  Lunisolar year had been in use: but this year being of an uncertain
  length, and so, unfit for Astronomy, in his days and in the days of his
  sons and grandsons, by observing the Heliacal Risings and Setting of the
  Stars, they found the length of the Solar year, and made it consist of
  five days more than the twelve calendar months of the old Lunisolar year.
  <i>Creusa</i> the daughter of <i>Erechtheus</i> marries <i>Xuthus</i> the
  son of <i>Hellen</i>. <i>Erechtheus</i> having first celebrated the
  <i>Panathenæa</i> joins horses to a chariot. <i>Ægina</i>, the daughter
  of <i>Asopus</i>, and mother of <i>Æacus</i>, born.</p>

  <p>1030. <i>Ceres</i> a woman of <i>Sicily</i>, in seeking her daughter
  who was stolen, comes into <i>Attica</i>, and there teaches the
  <i>Greeks</i> to sow corn; for which Benefaction she was Deified after
  death. She first taught the Art to <i>Triptolemus</i> the young son of
  <i>Celeus</i> King of <i>Eleusis</i>.</p>

  <p>1028. <i>Oenotrus</i> the youngest son of <i>Lycaon</i>, the
  <i>Janus</i> of the <i>Latines</i>, led the first Colony of <i>Greeks</i>
  into <i>Italy</i>, and there taught them to build houses. <i>Perseus</i>
  born.</p>

  <p>1020. <i>Arcas</i>, the son of <i>Callisto</i> and grandson of
  <i>Lycaon</i>, and <i>Eumelus</i> the first King of <i>Achaia</i>,
  receive bread-corn from <i>Triptolemus</i>.</p>

  <p>1019. <i>Solomon</i> Reigns, and marries the daughter of <i>Ammon</i>,
  and by means of this affinity is supplied with horses from <i>Egypt</i>;
  and his merchants also bring horses from thence for all the Kings of the
  <i>Hittites</i> and <i>Syrians</i>: for horses came originally from
  <i>Libya</i>; and thence <i>Neptune</i> was called <i>Equestris</i>.
  <i>Tantalus</i> King of <i>Phrygia</i> steals <i>Ganimede</i> the son of
  <i>Tros</i> King of <i>Troas</i>.</p>

  <p>1017. <i>Solomon</i> by the assistance of the <i>Tyrians</i> and
  <i>Aradians</i>, who had mariners among them acquainted with the <i>Red
  Sea</i>, sets out a fleet upon that sea. Those assistants build new
  cities in the <i>Persian Gulph</i>, called <i>Tyre</i> and
  <i>Aradus</i>.</p>

  <p>1015. The Temple of <i>Solomon</i> is founded. <i>Minos</i> Reigns in
  <i>Crete</i> expelling his father <i>Asterius</i>, who flees into
  <i>Italy</i>, and becomes the <i>Saturn</i> of the <i>Latines</i>.
  <i>Ammon</i> takes <i>Gezer</i> from the <i>Canaanites</i>, and gives it
  to his daughter, <i>Solomon's</i> wife.</p>

  <p>1014. <i>Ammon</i> places <i>Cepheus</i> at <i>Joppa</i>.</p>

  <p>1010. <i>Sesac</i> in the Reign of his father <i>Ammon</i> invades
  <i>Arabia F&#339;lix</i>, and sets up pillars at the mouth of the <i>Red
  Sea</i>. <i>Apis</i>, <i>Epaphus</i> or <i>Epopeus</i>, the son of
  <i>Phroroneus</i>, and <i>Nycteus</i> King of <i>B&#339;otia</i>, slain.
  <i>Lycus</i> inherits the Kingdom of his brother <i>Nycteus</i>.
  <i>Ætolus</i> the son of <i>Endymion</i> flies into the Country of the
  <i>Curetes</i> in <i>Achaia</i>, and calls it <i>Ætolia</i>; and of
  <i>Pronoe</i> the daughter of <i>Phorbas</i> begets <i>Pleuron</i> and
  <i>Calydon</i>, who built cities in <i>Ætolia</i> called by their own
  names. <i>Antiopa</i> the daughter of <i>Nycteus</i> is sent home to
  <i>Lycus</i> by <i>Lamedon</i> the successor of <i>Apis</i>, and in the
  way brings forth <i>Amphion</i> and <i>Zethus</i>.</p>

  <p>1008. <i>Sesac</i>, in the Reign of his father <i>Ammon</i>, invades
  <i>Afric</i> and <i>Spain</i>, and sets up pillars in all his conquests,
  and particularly at the mouth of the <i>Mediterranean</i>, and returns
  home by the coast of <i>Gaul</i> and <i>Italy</i>.</p>

  <p>1007. <i>Ceres</i> being dead <i>Eumolpus</i> institutes her Mysteries
  in <i>Eleusine</i>. The Mysteries of <i>Rhea</i> are instituted in
  <i>Phrygia</i>, in the city <i>Cybele</i>. About this time Temples begin
  to be built in <i>Greece</i>. <i>Hyagnis</i> the <i>Phrygian</i> invents
  the pipe. After the example of the common-council of the five Lords of
  the <i>Philistims</i>, the <i>Greeks</i> set up the <i>Amphictyonic</i>
  Council, first at <i>Thermopylæ</i>, by the influence of
  <i>Amphictyon</i> the son of <i>Deucalion</i>; and a few years after at
  <i>Delphi</i> by the influence of <i>Acrisius</i>. Among the cites, whose
  deputies met at <i>Thermopylæ</i>, I do not find <i>Athens</i>, and
  therefore doubt whether <i>Amphictyon</i> was King of that city. If he
  was the son of <i>Deucalion</i> and brother of <i>Hellen</i>, he and
  <i>Cranaus</i> might Reign together in several parts of <i>Attica</i>.
  But I meet with a later <i>Amphictyon</i> who entertained the great
  <i>Bacchus</i>. This Council worshipped <i>Ceres</i>, and therefore was
  instituted after her death.</p>

  <p>1006. <i>Minos</i> prepares a fleet, clears the <i>Greek</i> seas of
  Pyrates, and sends Colonies to the Islands of the <i>Greeks</i>, some of
  which were not inhabited before. <i>Cecrops</i> II. Reigns in
  <i>Attica</i>. <i>Caucon</i> teaches the Mysteries of <i>Ceres</i> in
  <i>Messene</i>.</p>

  <p>1005. <i>Andromeda</i> carried away from <i>Joppa</i> by
  <i>Perseus</i>. <i>Pandion</i> the brother of <i>Cecrops</i> II. Reigns
  in <i>Attica</i>. <i>Car</i>, the son of <i>Phoroneus</i>, builds a
  Temple to <i>Ceres</i>.</p>

  <p>1002. <i>Sesac</i> Reigns in <i>Egypt</i> and adorns <i>Thebes</i>,
  dedicating it to his father <i>Ammon</i> by the name of <i>No-Ammon</i>
  or <i>Ammon-No</i>, that is the people or city of <i>Ammon</i>: whence
  the <i>Greeks</i> called it <i>Diospolis</i>, the city of <i>Jupiter</i>.
  <i>Sesac</i> also erected Temples and Oracles to his father in
  <i>Thebes</i>, <i>Ammonia</i>, and <i>Ethiopia</i>, and thereby caused
  his father to be worshipped as a God in those countries, and I think also
  in <i>Arabia F&#339;lix</i>: and this was the original of the worship of
  <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>, and the first mention of Oracles that I meet with
  in Prophane History. War between <i>Pandion</i> and <i>Labdacus</i> the
  grandson of <i>Cadmus</i>.</p>

  <p>994. <i>Ægeus</i> Reigns in <i>Attica</i>.</p>

  <p>993. <i>Pelops</i> the son of <i>Tantalus</i> comes into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>, marries <i>Hippodamia</i> the granddaughter of
  <i>Acrisius</i>, takes <i>Ætolia</i> from <i>Ætolus</i> the son of
  <i>Endymion</i>, and by his riches grows potent.</p>

  <p>990. <i>Amphion</i> and <i>Zethus</i> slay <i>Lycus</i>, put
  <i>Laius</i> the son of <i>Labdacus</i> to flight, and Reign in
  <i>Thebes</i>, and wall the city about.</p>

  <p>989. <i>Dædalus</i> and his nephew <i>Talus</i> invent the saw, the
  turning-lath, the wimble, the chip-ax, and other instruments of
  Carpenters and Joyners, and thereby give a beginning to those Arts in
  <i>Europe</i>. <i>Dædalus</i> also invented the making of Statues with
  their feet asunder, as if they walked.</p>

  <p>988. <i>Minos</i> makes war upon the <i>Athenians</i>, for killing his
  son <i>Androgeus</i>. <i>Æacus</i> flourishes.</p>

  <p>987. <i>Dædalus</i> kills his nephew <i>Talus</i>, and flies to
  <i>Minos</i>. A Priestess of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>, being brought by
  <i>Ph&#339;nician</i> merchants into <i>Greece</i>, sets up the Oracle of
  <i>Jupiter</i> at <i>Dodona</i>. This gives a beginning to Oracles in
  <i>Greece</i>: and by their dictates, the Worship of the Dead is every
  where introduced.</p>

  <p>983. <i>Sisyphus</i>, the son of <i>Æolus</i> and grandson of
  <i>Hellen</i>, Reigns in <i>Corinth</i>, and some say that he built that
  city.</p>

  <p>980. <i>Laius</i> recovers the Kingdom of <i>Thebes</i>.
  <i>Athamas</i>, the brother of <i>Sisyphus</i> and father of
  <i>Phrixus</i> and <i>Helle</i>, marries <i>Ino</i> the daughter of
  <i>Cadmus</i>.</p>

  <p>979. <i>Rehoboam</i> Reigns. <i>Thoas</i> is sent from <i>Crete</i> to
  <i>Lemnos</i>, Reigns there in the city <i>Heph&#339;stia</i>, and works
  in copper and iron.</p>

  <p>978. <i>Alcmena</i> born of <i>Electryo</i> the son of <i>Perseus</i>
  and <i>Andromeda</i>, and of <i>Lysidice</i> the daughter of
  <i>Pelops</i>.</p>

  <p>974. <i>Sesac</i> spoils the Temple, and invades <i>Syria</i> and
  <i>Persia</i>, setting up pillars in many places. <i>Jeroboam</i>,
  becoming subject to <i>Sesac</i>, sets up the worship of the
  <i>Egyptian</i> Gods in <i>Israel</i>.</p>

  <p>971. <i>Sesac</i> invades <i>India</i>, and returns with triumph the
  next year but one: whence <i>Trieterica Bacchi</i>. He sets up pillars on
  two mountains at the mouth of the river <i>Ganges</i>.</p>

  <p>968. <i>Theseus</i> Reigns, having overcome the <i>Minotaur</i>, and
  soon after unites the twelve cities of <i>Attica</i> under one
  government. <i>Sesac</i>, having carried on his victories to <i>Mount
  Caucasus</i>, leaves his nephew <i>Prometheus</i> there, and <i>Æetes</i>
  in <i>Colchis</i>.</p>

  <p>967. <i>Sesac</i>, passing over the <i>Hellespont</i> conquers
  <i>Thrace</i>, kills <i>Lycurgus</i> King thereof, and gives his Kingdom
  and one of his singing-women to <i>Oeagrus</i> the father of
  <i>Orpheus</i>. <i>Sesac</i> had in his army <i>Ethiopians</i> commanded
  by <i>Pan</i>, and <i>Libyan</i> women commanded by <i>Myrina</i> or
  <i>Minerva</i>. It was the custom of the <i>Ethiopians</i> to dance when
  they were entring into a battel, and from their skipping they were
  painted with goats feet in the form of Satyrs.</p>

  <p>966. <i>Thoas</i>, being made King of <i>Cyprus</i> by <i>Sesac</i>,
  goes thither with his wife <i>Calycopis</i>, and leaves his daughter
  <i>Hypsipyle</i> in <i>Lemnos</i>.</p>

  <p>965. <i>Sesac</i> is baffled by the <i>Greeks</i> and
  <i>Scythians</i>, loses many of his women with their Queen
  <i>Minerva</i>, composes the war, is received by <i>Amphiction</i> at a
  feast, buries <i>Ariadne</i>, goes back through <i>Asia</i> and
  <i>Syria</i> into <i>Egypt</i>, with innumerable captives, among whom was
  <i>Tithonus</i>, the son of <i>Laomedon</i> King of <i>Troy</i>; and
  leaves his <i>Libyan Amazons</i>, under <i>Marthesia</i> and
  <i>Lampeto</i>, the successors of <i>Minerva</i>, at the river
  <i>Thermodon</i>. He left also in <i>Colchos</i> Geographical Tables of
  all his conquests: And thence Geography had its rise. His singing-women
  were celebrated in <i>Thrace</i> by the name of the Muses. And the
  daughters of <i>Pierus</i> a <i>Thracian</i>, imitating them, were
  celebrated by the same name.</p>

  <p>964. <i>Minos</i>, making war upon <i>Cocalus</i> King of
  <i>Sicily</i>, is slain by him. He was eminent for his Dominion, his Laws
  and his Justice: upon his sepulchre visited by <i>Pythagoras</i>, was
  this inscription, <span lang="el" title="TOU DIOS" >&#x3A4;&#x39F;&#x3A5;
  &#x394;&#x399;&#x39F;&#x3A3;</span> the Sepulchre of <i>Jupiter</i>.
  <i>Danaus</i> with his daughters flying from his brother <i>Egyptus</i>
  (that is from <i>Sesac</i>) comes into <i>Greece</i>. <i>Sesac</i> using
  the advice of his Secretary <i>Thoth</i>, distributes <i>Egypt</i> into
  xxxvi <i>Nomes</i>, and in every <i>Nome</i> erects a Temple, and
  appoints the several Gods, Festivals and Religions of the several
  <i>Nomes</i>. The Temples were the sepulchres of his great men, where
  they were to be buried and worshipped after death, each in his own
  Temple, with ceremonies and festivals appointed by him; while He and his
  Queen, by the names of <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i>, were to be
  worshipped in all <i>Egypt</i>. These were the Temples seen and described
  by <i>Lucian</i> eleven hundred years after, to be of one and the same
  age: and this was the original of the several <i>Nomes</i> of
  <i>Egypt</i>, and of the several Gods and several Religions of those
  <i>Nomes</i>. <i>Sesac</i> divided also the land of <i>Egypt</i> by
  measure amongst his soldiers, and thence <i>Geometry</i> had its rise.
  <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Eurystheus</i> born.</p>

  <p>963. <i>Amphictyon</i> brings the twelve Gods of <i>Egypt</i> into
  <i>Greece</i>, and these are the <i>Dii magni majorum gentium</i>, to
  whom the Earth and Planets and Elements are dedicated.</p>

  <p>962. <i>Phryxus</i> and <i>Helle</i> fly from their stepmother
  <i>Ino</i> the daughter of <i>Cadmus</i>. <i>Helle</i> is drowned in the
  <i>Hellespont</i>, so named from her, but <i>Phryxus</i> arrived at
  <i>Colchos</i>.</p>

  <p>960. The war between the <i>Lapithæ</i> and the people of
  <i>Thessaly</i> called <i>Centaurs</i>.</p>

  <p>958. <i>Oedipus</i> kills his father <i>Laius</i>. <i>Sthenelus</i>
  the son of <i>Perseus</i> Reigns in <i>Mycene</i>.</p>

  <p>956. <i>Sesac</i> is slain by his brother <i>Japetus</i>, who after
  death was deified in <i>Afric</i> by the name of <i>Neptune</i>, and
  called <i>Typhon</i> by the <i>Egyptians</i>. <i>Orus</i> Reigns and
  routs the <i>Libyans</i>, who under the conduct of <i>Japetus</i>, and
  his Son <i>Antæus</i> or <i>Atlas</i>, invaded <i>Egypt</i>. <i>Sesac</i>
  from his making the river <i>Nile</i> useful, by cutting channels from it
  to all the cities of <i>Egypt</i>, was called by its names, <i>Sihor</i>
  or <i>Siris</i>, <i>Nilus</i> and <i>Egyptus</i>. The <i>Greeks</i>
  hearing the <i>Egyptians</i> lament, <i>O Siris</i> and <i>Bou Siris</i>,
  called him <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Busiris</i>. The <i>Arabians</i> from his
  great acts called him <i>Bacchus</i>, that is, the Great. The
  <i>Phrygians</i> called him <i>Ma-fors</i> or <i>Mavors</i>, the valiant,
  and by contraction <i>Mars</i>. Because he set up pillars in all his
  conquests, and his army in his father's Reign fought against the
  <i>Africans</i> with clubs, he is painted with pillars and a club: and
  this is that <i>Hercules</i> who, according to <i>Cicero</i>, was born
  upon the <i>Nile</i>, and according to <i>Eudoxus</i>, was slain by
  <i>Typhon</i>; and according to <i>Diodorus</i>, was an <i>Egyptian</i>,
  and went over a great part of the world, and set up the pillars in
  <i>Afric</i>. He seems to be also the <i>Belus</i> who, according to
  <i>Diodorus</i>, led a Colony of <i>Egyptians</i> to <i>Babylon</i>, and
  there instituted Priests called <i>Chaldeans</i>, who were free from
  taxes, and observed the stars, as in <i>Egypt</i>. Hitherto <i>Judah</i>
  and <i>Israel</i> laboured under great vexations, but henceforward
  <i>Asa</i> King of <i>Judah</i> had peace ten years.</p>

  <p>947. The <i>Ethiopians</i> invade <i>Egypt</i>, and drown <i>Orus</i>
  in the <i>Nile</i>. Thereupon <i>Bubaste</i> the sister of <i>Orus</i>
  kills herself, by falling from the top of an house, and their mother
  <i>Isis</i> or <i>Astræa</i> goes mad: and thus ended the Reign of the
  Gods of <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

  <p>946. <i>Zerah</i> the <i>Ethiopian</i> is overthrown by <i>Asa</i>.
  The people of the lower <i>Egypt</i> make <i>Osarsiphus</i> their King,
  and call in two hundred thousand <i>Jews</i> and <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>
  against the <i>Ethiopians</i>. <i>Menes</i> or <i>Amenophis</i> the young
  son of <i>Zerah</i> and <i>Cissia</i> Reigns.</p>

  <p>944. The <i>Ethiopians</i>, under <i>Amenophis</i>, retire from the
  lower <i>Egypt</i> and fortify <i>Memphis</i> against <i>Osarsiphus</i>.
  And by these wars and the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition, the great Empire
  of <i>Egypt</i> breaks in pieces. <i>Eurystheus</i> the son of
  <i>Sthenelus</i> Reigns in <i>Mycenæ</i>.</p>

  <p>943. <i>Evander</i> and his mother <i>Carmenta</i> carry Letters into
  <i>Italy</i>.</p>

  <p>942. <i>Orpheus</i> Deifies the son of <i>Semele</i> by the name of
  <i>Bacchus</i>, and appoints his Ceremonies.</p>

  <p>940. The great men of <i>Greece</i>, hearing of the civil wars and
  distractions of <i>Egypt</i>, resolve to send an embassy to the nations,
  upon the <i>Euxine</i> and <i>Mediterranean</i> Seas, subject to that
  Empire, and for that end order the building of the ship <i>Argo</i>.</p>

  <p>939. The ship <i>Argo</i> is built after the pattern of the long ship
  in which <i>Danaus</i> came into <i>Greece</i>: and this was the first
  long ship built by the <i>Greeks</i>. <i>Chiron</i>, who was born in the
  Golden Age, forms the Constellations for the use of the <i>Argonauts</i>;
  and places the Solstitial and Equinoctial Points in the fifteenth degrees
  or middles of the Constellations of <i>Cancer</i>, <i>Chelæ</i>,
  <i>Capricorn</i>, and <i>Aries</i>. <i>Meton</i> in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 316, observed the Summer Solstice in the eighth degree
  of <i>Cancer</i>, and therefore the Solstice had then gone back seven
  degrees. It goes back one degree in about seventytwo years, and seven
  degrees in about 504 years. Count these years back from the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 316, and they will place the <i>Argonautic</i>
  expedition about 936 years before <i>Christ</i>. <i>Gingris</i> the son
  of <i>Thoas</i> slain, and Deified by the name of <i>Adonis</i>.</p>

  <p>938. <i>Theseus</i>, being fifty years old, steals <i>Helena</i> then
  seven years old. <i>Pirithous</i> the son of <i>Ixion</i>, endeavouring
  to steal <i>Persephone</i> the daughter of <i>Orcus</i> King of the
  <i>Molossians</i>, is slain by the Dog of <i>Orcus</i>; and his companion
  <i>Theseus</i> is taken and imprisoned. <i>Helena</i> is set at liberty
  by her brothers.</p>

  <p>937. The <i>Argonautic</i> expedition. <i>Prometheus</i> leaves
  <i>Mount Caucasus</i>, being set at liberty by <i>Hercules</i>.
  <i>Laomedon</i> King of <i>Troy</i> is slain by <i>Hercules</i>.
  <i>Priam</i> succeeds him. <i>Talus</i> a brazen man, of the Brazen Age,
  the son of <i>Minos</i>, is slain by the <i>Argonauts</i>.
  <i>Æsculapius</i> and <i>Hercules</i> were <i>Argonauts</i>, and
  <i>Hippocrates</i> was the eighteenth from <i>Æsculapius</i> by the
  father's side, and the nineteenth from <i>Hercules</i> by the mother's
  side; and because these generations, being noted in history, were most
  probably by the chief of the family, and for the most part by the eldest
  sons; we may reckon 28 or at the most 30 years to a generation: and thus
  the seventeen intervals by the father's side and eighteen by the
  mother's, will at a middle reckoning amount unto about 507 years; which
  being counted backwards from the beginning of the <i>Peloponnesian</i>
  war, at which time <i>Hippocrates</i> began to flourish, will reach up to
  the time where we have placed the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition.</p>

  <p>936. <i>Theseus</i> is set at liberty by <i>Hercules</i>.</p>

  <p>934. The hunting of the <i>Calydonian</i> boar slain by
  <i>Meleager</i>.</p>

  <p>930. <i>Amenophis</i>, with an army out of <i>Ethiopia</i> and
  <i>Thebais</i>, invades the lower <i>Egypt</i>, conquers
  <i>Osarsiphus</i>, and drives out the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Canaanites</i>:
  and this is reckoned the second expulsion of the Shepherds.
  <i>Calycopis</i> dies, and is Deified by <i>Thoas</i> with Temples at
  <i>Paphos</i> and <i>Amathus</i> in <i>Cyprus</i>, and at <i>Byblus</i>
  in <i>Syria</i>, and with Priests and sacred Rites, and becomes the
  <i>Venus</i> of the ancients, and the <i>Dea Cypria</i> and <i>Dea
  Syria</i>. And from these and other places where Temples were erected to
  her, she was also called <i>Paphia</i>, <i>Amathusia</i>, <i>Byblia</i>,
  <i>Cytherea</i>, <i>Salaminia</i>, <i>Cnidia</i>, <i>Erycina</i>,
  <i>Idalia</i>, &amp;c. And her three waiting-women became the three
  Graces.</p>

  <p>928. The war of the seven Captains against <i>Thebes</i>.</p>

  <p>927. <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Æsculapius</i> are Deified.
  <i>Eurystheus</i> drives the <i>Heraclides</i> out of
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>. He is slain by <i>Hyllus</i> the son of
  <i>Hercules</i>. <i>Atreus</i> the son of <i>Pelops</i> succeeds him in
  the Kingdom of <i>Mycenæ</i>. <i>Menestheus</i>, the great grandson of
  <i>Erechtheus</i>, Reigns at <i>Athens</i>.</p>

  <p>925. <i>Theseus</i> is slain, being cast down from a rock.</p>

  <p>924. <i>Hyllus</i> invading <i>Peloponnesus</i> is slain by
  <i>Echemus</i>.</p>

  <p>919. <i>Atreus</i> dies. <i>Agamemnon</i> Reigns. In the absence of
  <i>Menelaus</i>, who went to look after what his father <i>Atreus</i> had
  left to him, <i>Paris</i> steals <i>Helena</i>.</p>

  <p>918. The second war against <i>Thebes</i>.</p>

  <p>912. <i>Thoas</i>, King of <i>Cyprus</i> and part of
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> dies; and for making armour for the Kings of
  <i>Egypt</i>; is Deified with a sumptuous Temple at <i>Memphis</i> by the
  name of <i>Baal Canaan</i>, <i>Vulcan</i>. This Temple was said to be
  built by <i>Menes</i>, the first King of <i>Egypt</i> who reigned next
  after the Gods, that is, by <i>Menoph</i> or <i>Amenophis</i> who reigned
  next after the death of <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, <i>Orus</i>,
  <i>Bubaste</i> and <i>Thoth</i>. The city, <i>Memphis</i> was also said
  to be built by <i>Menes</i>; he began to build it when he fortified it
  against <i>Osarsiphus</i>. And from him it was called <i>Menoph</i>,
  <i>Moph</i>, <i>Noph</i>, &amp;c; and is to this day called <i>Menuf</i>
  by the <i>Arabians</i>. And therefore <i>Menes</i> who built the city and
  temple Was <i>Menoph</i> or <i>Amenophis</i>. The Priests of <i>Egypt</i>
  at length made this temple above a thousand years older then
  <i>Amenophis</i>, and some of them five or ten thousand years older: but
  it could not be above two or three hundred years older than the Reign of
  <i>Psammiticus</i> who finished it, and died 614 years before
  <i>Christ</i>. When <i>Menoph</i> or <i>Menes</i> built the city, he
  built a bridge there over the <i>Nile</i>: a work too great to be older
  than the Monarchy of <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

  <p>909. <i>Amenophis</i>, called <i>Memnon</i> by the <i>Greeks</i>,
  built the <i>Memnonia</i> at <i>Susa</i>, whilst <i>Egypt</i> was under
  the government of <i>Proteus</i> his Viceroy.</p>

  <p>904. <i>Troy</i> taken. <i>Amenophis</i> was still at <i>Susa</i>; the
  <i>Greeks</i> feigning that he came from thence to the <i>Trojan</i>
  war.</p>

  <p>903. <i>Demophoon</i>, the son of <i>Theseus</i> by <i>Ph&#339;dra</i>
  the daughter of <i>Minos</i>, Reigns at <i>Athens</i>.</p>

  <p>901. <i>Amenophis</i> builds small Pyramids in <i>Cochome</i>.</p>

  <p>896. <i>Ulysses</i> leaves <i>Calypso</i> in the Island <i>Ogygie</i>
  (perhaps <i>Cadis</i> or <i>Cales</i>.) She was the daughter of
  <i>Atlas</i>, according to <i>Homer</i>. The ancients at length feigned
  that this Island, (which from <i>Atlas</i> they called <i>Atlantis</i>)
  had been as big as all <i>Europe</i>, <i>Africa</i> and <i>Asia</i>, but
  was sunk into the Sea.</p>

  <p>895. <i>Teucer</i> builds <i>Salamis</i> in <i>Cyprus</i>.
  <i>Hadad</i> or <i>Benhadad</i> King of <i>Syria</i> dies, and is Deified
  at <i>Damascus</i> with a Temple and Ceremonies.</p>

  <p>887. <i>Amenophis</i> dies, and is succeeded by his son
  <i>Ramesses</i> or <i>Rhampsinitus</i>, who builds the western Portico of
  the Temple of <i>Vulcan</i>. The <i>Egyptians</i> dedicated to
  <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, <i>Orus</i> senior, <i>Typhon</i>, and
  <i>Nephthe</i> the sister and wife of <i>Typhon</i>, the five days added
  by the <i>Egyptians</i> to the twelve Calendar months of the old
  Luni-solar year, and said that they were added when these five Princes
  were born. They were therefore added in the Reign of <i>Ammon</i> the
  father of these five Princes: but this year was scarce brought into
  common use before the Reign of <i>Amenophis</i>: for in his Temple or
  Sepulchre at <i>Abydus</i>, they placed a Circle of 365 cubits in
  compass, covered on the upper side with a plate of gold, and divided into
  365 equal parts, to represent all the days of the year; every part having
  the day of the year, and the Heliacal Risings and Settings of the Stars
  on that day, noted upon it. And this Circle remained there 'till
  <i>Cambyses</i> spoiled the temples of <i>Egypt</i>: and from this
  monument I collect that it was <i>Amenophis</i> who established this
  year, fixing the beginning thereof to one of the four Cardinal Points of
  the heavens. For had not the beginning thereof been now fixed, the
  Heliacal Risings and Settings of the Stars could not have been noted upon
  the days thereof. The Priests of <i>Egypt</i> therefore in the Reign of
  <i>Amenophis</i> continued to observe the Heliacal Risings and Settings
  of the Stars upon every day. And when by the Sun's Meridional Altitudes
  they had found the Solstices and Equinoxes according to the Sun's mean
  motion, his Equation being not yet known, they fixed the beginning of
  this year to the Vernal Equinox, and in memory thereof erected this
  monument. Now this year being carried into <i>Chaldæa</i>, the
  <i>Chaldæans</i> began their year of <i>Nabonassar</i> on the same
  <i>Thoth</i> with the <i>Egyptians</i>, and made it of the same length.
  And the <i>Thoth</i> of the first year of <i>Nabonassar</i> fell upon the
  26th day of <i>February</i>: which was 33 days and five hours before the
  Vernal Equinox, according to the Sun's mean motion. And the <i>Thoth</i>
  of this year moves backwards 33 days and five hours in 137 years, and
  therefore fell upon the Vernal Equinox 137 years before the <i>Æra</i> of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> began; that is, 884 years before <i>Christ</i>. And if
  it began upon the day next after the Vernal Equinox, it might begin three
  or four years earlier; and there we may place the death of this King. The
  <i>Greeks</i> feigned that he was the Son of <i>Tithonus</i>, and
  therefore he was born after the return of <i>Sesac</i> into <i>Egypt</i>,
  with <i>Tithonus</i> and other captives, and so might be about 70 or 75
  years old at his death.</p>

  <p>883. <i>Dido</i> builds <i>Carthage</i>, and the
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> begin presently after to sail as far as to the
  <i>Straights Mouth</i>, and beyond. <i>Æneas</i> was still alive,
  according to <i>Virgil</i>.</p>

  <p>870. <i>Hesiod</i> flourishes. He hath told us himself that he lived
  in the age next after the wars of <i>Thebes</i> and <i>Troy</i>, and that
  this age should end when the men then living grew hoary and dropt into
  the grave; and therefore it was but of an ordinary length: and
  <i>Herodotus</i> has told us that <i>Hesiod</i> and <i>Homer</i> were but
  400 years older than himself. Whence it follows that the destruction of
  <i>Troy</i> was not older than we have represented it.</p>

  <p>860. <i>M&#339;ris</i> Reigns in <i>Egypt</i>. He adorned
  <i>Memphis</i>, and translated the seat of his Empire thither from
  <i>Thebes</i>. There he built the famous Labyrinth, and the northern
  portico of the Temple of <i>Vulcan</i>, and dug the great Lake called the
  Lake of <i>M&#339;ris</i>, and upon the bottom of it built two great
  Pyramids of brick: and these things being not mentioned by <i>Homer</i>
  or <i>Hesiod</i>, were unknown to them, and done after their days.
  <i>M&#339;ris</i> wrote also a book of Geometry.</p>

  <p>852. <i>Hazael</i> the successor of <i>Hadad</i> at <i>Damascus</i>
  dies and is Deified, as was <i>Hadad</i> before: and these Gods, together
  with <i>Arathes</i> the wife of <i>Hadad</i>, were worshipt in their
  Sepulchres or Temples, 'till the days of <i>Josephus</i> the <i>Jew</i>;
  and the <i>Syrians</i> boasted their antiquity, not knowing, saith
  <i>Josephus</i>, that they were novel.</p>

  <p>844. The <i>Æolic</i> Migration. <i>B&#339;otia</i>, formerly called
  <i>Cadmeis</i>, is seized by the <i>B&#339;otians</i>.</p>

  <p>838. <i>Cheops</i> Reigns in <i>Egypt</i>. He built the greatest
  Pyramid for his sepulchre, and forbad the worship of the former Kings;
  intending to have been worshipped himself.</p>

  <p>825. The <i>Heraclides</i>, after three Generations, or an hundred
  years, reckoned from their former expedition, return into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>. Henceforward, to the end of the first
  <i>Messenian</i> war, reigned ten Kings of <i>Sparta</i> by one Race, and
  nine by another; ten of <i>Messene</i>, and nine of <i>Arcadia</i>:
  which, by reckoning (according to the ordinary course of nature) about
  twenty years to a Reign, one Reign with another, will take up about 190
  years. And the seven Reigns more in one of the two Races of the Kings of
  <i>Sparta</i>, and eight in the other, to the battle at
  <i>Thermopylæ</i>; may take up 150 years more: and so place the return of
  the <i>Heraclides</i>, about 820 years before <i>Christ</i>.</p>

  <p>824. <i>Cephren</i> Reigns in <i>Egypt</i>, and builds another great
  Pyramid.</p>

  <p>808. <i>Mycerinus</i> Reigns there, and begins the third great
  Pyramid. He shut up the body of his daughter in a hollow ox, and caused
  her to be worshipped daily with odours.</p>

  <p>804. The war, between the <i>Athenians</i> and <i>Spartans</i>, in
  which <i>Codrus</i>, King of the <i>Athenians</i>, is slain.</p>

  <p>801. <i>Nitocris</i>, the sister of <i>Mycerinus</i>, succeeds him,
  and finishes the third great Pyramid.</p>

  <p>794. The <i>Ionic</i> Migration, under the conduct of the sons of
  <i>Codrus</i>.</p>

  <p>790. <i>Pul</i> founds the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire.</p>

  <p>788. <i>Asychis</i> Reigns in <i>Egypt</i>, and builds the eastern
  Portico of the Temple of <i>Vulcan</i> very splendidly; and a large
  Pyramid of brick, made of mud dug out of the Lake of <i>M&#339;ris</i>.
  <i>Egypt</i> breaks into several Kingdoms. <i>Gnephactus</i> and
  <i>Bocchoris</i> Reign successively in the upper <i>Egypt</i>;
  <i>Stephanathis</i>; <i>Necepsos</i> and <i>Nechus</i>, at <i>Sais</i>;
  <i>Anysis</i> or <i>Amosis</i>, at <i>Anysis</i> or <i>Hanes</i>; and
  <i>Tacellotis</i>, at <i>Bubaste</i>.</p>

  <p>776. <i>Iphitus</i> restores the Olympiads. And from this <i>Æra</i>
  the Olympiads are now reckoned. <i>Gnephactus</i> Reigns at
  <i>Memphis</i>.</p>

  <p>772. <i>Necepsos</i> and <i>Petosiris</i> invent Astrology in
  <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

  <p>760. <i>Semiramis</i> begins to flourish; <i>Sanchoniatho</i>
  writes.</p>

  <p>751. <i>Sabacon</i> the <i>Ethiopian</i>, invades <i>Egypt</i>, now
  divided into various Kingdoms, burns <i>Bocchoris</i>, slays
  <i>Nechus</i>, and makes <i>Anysis</i> fly.</p>

  <p>747. <i>Pul</i>, King of <i>Assyria</i>, dies, and is succeeded at
  <i>Nineveh</i> by <i>Tiglathpilasser</i>, and at <i>Babylon</i> by
  <i>Nabonassar</i>. The <i>Egyptians</i>, who fled from <i>Sabacon</i>,
  carry their Astrology and Astronomy to <i>Babylon</i>, and found the
  <i>Æra</i> of <i>Nabonassar</i> in <i>Egyptian</i> years.</p>

  <p>740. <i>Tiglathpilasser</i>, King of <i>Assyria</i>, takes
  <i>Damascus</i>, and captivates the <i>Syrians</i>.</p>

  <p>729. <i>Tiglathpilasser</i> is succeeded by <i>Salmanasser</i>.</p>

  <p>721. <i>Salmanasser</i>, King of <i>Assyria</i>, carries the Ten
  Tribes into captivity.</p>

  <p>719. <i>Sennacherib</i> Reigns over <i>Assyria</i>. <i>Archias</i> the
  son of <i>Evagetus</i>, of the stock of <i>Hercules</i>, leads a Colony
  from <i>Corinth</i> into <i>Sicily</i>, and builds <i>Syracuse</i>.</p>

  <p>717. <i>Tirhakah</i> Reigns in <i>Ethiopia</i>.</p>

  <p>714. <i>Sennacherib</i> is put to flight by the <i>Ethiopians</i> and
  <i>Egyptians</i>, with great slaughter.</p>

  <p>711. The <i>Medes</i> revolt from the <i>Assyrians</i>.
  <i>Sennacherib</i> slain. <i>Asserhadon</i> succeeds him. This is that
  <i>Asserhadon-Pul</i>, or <i>Sardanapalus</i>, the son of
  <i>Anacyndaraxis</i>, or <i>Sennacherib</i>, who built <i>Tarsus</i> and
  <i>Anchiale</i> in one day.</p>

  <p>710. <i>Lycurgus</i>, brings the poems of <i>Homer</i> out of
  <i>Asia</i> into <i>Greece</i>.</p>

  <p>708. <i>Lycurgus</i>, becomes tutor to <i>Charillus</i> or
  <i>Charilaus</i>, the young King of <i>Sparta</i>. <i>Aristotle</i> makes
  <i>Lycurgus</i> as old as <i>Iphitus</i>, because his name was upon the
  Olympic Disc. But the Disc was one of the five games called the
  <i>Quinquertium</i>, and the <i>Quinquertium</i> was first instituted
  upon the eighteenth Olympiad. <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Thucydides</i> made
  the institutions of <i>Lycurgus</i> about 300 years older than the end of
  the <i>Peloponnesian</i> war, that is, 705 years before
  <i>Christ</i>.</p>

  <p>701. <i>Sabacon</i>, after a Reign of 50 years, relinquishes
  <i>Egypt</i> to his son <i>Sevechus</i> or <i>Sethon</i>, who becomes
  Priest of <i>Vulcan</i>, and neglects military affairs.</p>

  <p>698. <i>Manasseh</i> Reigns.</p>

  <p>697. The <i>Corinthians</i> begin first of any men to build ships with
  three orders of oars, called <i>Triremes</i>. Hitherto the <i>Greeks</i>
  had used long vessels of fifty oars.</p>

  <p>687. <i>Tirhakah</i> Reigns in <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

  <p>681. <i>Asserhadon</i> invades <i>Babylon</i>.</p>

  <p>673. The <i>Jews</i> conquered by <i>Asserhadon</i>, and
  <i>Manasseh</i> carried captive to <i>Babylon</i>.</p>

  <p>671. <i>Asserbadon</i> invades <i>Egypt</i>. The government of
  <i>Egypt</i> committed to twelve princes.</p>

  <p>668. The western nations of <i>Syria</i>, <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and
  <i>Egypt</i>, revolt from the <i>Assyrians</i>. <i>Asserhadon</i> dies,
  and is succeeded by <i>Saosduchinus</i>. <i>Manasseh</i> returns from
  Captivity.</p>

  <p>658. <i>Phraortes</i> Reigns in <i>Media</i>. The <i>Prytanes</i>
  Reign in <i>Corinth</i>, expelling their Kings.</p>

  <p>657. The <i>Corinthians</i> overcome the <i>Corcyreans</i> at sea: and
  this was the oldest sea fight.</p>

  <p>655. <i>Psammiticus</i> becomes King of all <i>Egypt</i>, by
  conquering the other eleven Kings with whom he had already reigned
  fifteen years: he reigned about 39 years more. Henceforward the
  <i>Ionians</i> had access into <i>Egypt</i>; and thence came the
  <i>Ionian</i> Philosophy, Astronomy and Geometry.</p>

  <p>652. The first <i>Messenian</i> war begins: it lasted twenty
  years.</p>

  <p>647. <i>Charops</i>, the first decennial Archon of the
  <i>Athenians</i>. Some of these Archons might dye before the end of the
  ten years, and the remainder of the ten years be supplied by a new
  Archon. And hence the seven decennial Archons might not take up above
  forty or fifty years. <i>Saosduchinus</i> King of <i>Assyria</i> dies,
  and is succeeded by <i>Chyniladon</i>.</p>

  <p>640. <i>Josiah</i> Reigns in <i>Judæa</i>.</p>

  <p>636. <i>Phraortes</i>> King of the <i>Medes</i>, is slain in a war
  against the <i>Assyrians</i>. <i>Astyages</i> succeeds him.</p>

  <p>635. The <i>Scythians</i> invade the <i>Medes</i> and
  <i>Assyrians</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Chronology of the First Ages of
the </i>Greeks<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>All Nations, before they began to keep exact accounts of Time, have
  been prone to raise their Antiquities; and this humour has been promoted,
  by the Contentions between Nations about their Originals.
  <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> tells
  us, that the Priests of <i>Egypt</i> reckoned from the Reign of
  <i>Menes</i> to that of <i>Sethon</i>, who put <i>Sennacherib</i> to
  flight, three hundred forty and one Generations of men, and as many
  Priests of <i>Vulcan</i>, and as many Kings of <i>Egypt</i>: and that
  three hundred Generations make ten thousand years; <i>for</i>, saith he,
  <i>three Generations of men make an hundred years</i>: and the remaining
  forty and one Generations make 1340 years: and so the whole time from the
  Reign of <i>Menes</i> to that of <i>Sethon</i> was 11340 years. And by
  this way of reckoning, and allotting longer Reigns to the Gods of
  <i>Egypt</i> than to the Kings which followed them, <i>Herodotus</i>
  tells us from the Priests of <i>Egypt</i>, that from <i>Pan</i> to
  <i>Amosis</i> were 15000 years, and from <i>Hercules</i> to <i>Amosis</i>
  17000 years. So also the <i>Chaldæans</i> boasted of their Antiquity; for
  <i>Callisthenes</i>, the Disciple of <i>Aristotle</i>, sent Astronomical
  Observations from <i>Babylon</i> to <i>Greece</i>, said to be of 1903
  years standing before the times of <i>Alexander</i> the great. And the
  <i>Chaldæans</i> boasted further, that they had observed the Stars 473000
  years; and there were others who made the Kingdoms of <i>Assyria</i>,
  <i>Media</i> and <i>Damascus</i>, much older than the truth.</p>

  <p>Some of the <i>Greeks</i> called the times before the Reign of
  <i>Ogyges</i>, Unknown, because they had No History of them; those
  between his flood and the beginning of the Olympiads, Fabulous, because
  their History was much mixed with Poetical Fables: and those after the
  beginning of the Olympiads, Historical, because their History was free
  from such Fables. The fabulous Ages wanted a good Chronology, and so also
  did the Historical, for the first 60 or 70 Olympiads.</p>

  <p>The <i>Europeans</i>, had no Chronology before the times of the
  <i>Persian</i> Empire: and whatsoever Chronology they now have of
  ancienter times, hath been framed since, by reasoning and conjecture. In
  the beginning of that Monarchy, <i>Acusilaus</i> made <i>Phoroneus</i> as
  old as <i>Ogyges</i> and his flood, and that flood 1020 years older than
  the first Olympiad; which is above 680 years older than the truth: and to
  make out this reckoning his followers have encreased the Reigns of Kings
  in length and number. <i>Plutarch</i> <a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> tells us that the Philosophers anciently
  delivered their Opinions in Verse, as <i>Orpheus</i>, <i>Hesiod</i>,
  <i>Parmenides</i>, <i>Xenophanes</i>, <i>Empedocles</i>, <i>Thales</i>;
  but afterwards left off the use of Verses; and that <i>Aristarchus</i>,
  <i>Timocharis</i>, <i>Aristillus</i>, <i>Hipparchus</i>, did not make
  Astronomy the more contemptible by describing it in Prose; after
  <i>Eudoxus</i>, <i>Hesiod</i>, and <i>Thales</i> had wrote of it in
  Verse. <i>Solon</i> wrote <a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
  in Verse, and all the Seven Wise Men were addicted to Poetry, as
  <i>Anaximenes</i> <a name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
  affirmed. 'Till those days the <i>Greeks</i> wrote only in Verse, and
  while they did so there could be no Chronology, nor any other History,
  than such as was mixed with poetical fancies. <i>Pliny</i>, <a
  name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> in reckoning up the
  Inventors of things, tells us, <i>that </i>Pherecydes Syrius<i> taught to
  compose discourses in Prose in the Reign of </i>Cyrus<i>, and </i>Cadmus
  Milesius<i> to write History.</i> And in <a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> another place he saith <i>that </i>Cadmus
  Milesius<i> was the first that wrote in Prose</i>. <i>Josephus</i> tells
  us <a name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> that <i>Cadmus
  Milesius</i> and <i>Acusilaus</i> were but a little before the expedition
  of the <i>Persians</i> against the <i>Greeks</i>: and <i>Suidas</i> <a
  name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> calls <i>Acusilaus</i> a
  most ancient Historian, and saith that <i>he wrote Genealogies out of
  tables of brass, which his father, as was reported, found in a corner of
  his house</i>. Who hid them there may be doubted: For the <i>Greeks</i>
  <a name="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> had no publick table
  or inscription older than the Laws of <i>Draco</i>. <i>Pherecydes
  Atheniensis</i>, in the Reign of <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>, or soon after,
  wrote of the Antiquities and ancient Genealogies of the <i>Athenians</i>,
  in ten books; and was one of the first <i>European</i> writers of this
  kind, and one of the best; whence he had the name of <i>Genealogus</i>;
  and by <i>Dionysius <a name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
  Halicarnassensis</i> is said to be second to none of the Genealogers.
  <i>Epimenides</i>, not the Philosopher, but an Historian, wrote also of
  the ancient Genealogies: and <i>Hellanicus</i>, who was twelve years
  older than <i>Herodotus</i>, digested his History by the Ages or
  Successions of the Priestesses of <i>Juno Argiva</i>. Others digested
  theirs by those of the Archons of <i>Athens</i>, or Kings of the
  <i>Lacedæmonians</i>. <i>Hippias</i> the <i>Elean</i> published a
  Breviary of the Olympiads, supported by no certain arguments, as
  <i>Plutarch</i> <a name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> tells
  us: he lived in the 105th Olympiad, and was derided by <i>Plato</i> for
  his Ignorance. This Breviary seems to have contained nothing more than a
  short account of the Victors in every Olympiad. Then <a name="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> <i>Ephorus</i>, the disciple of
  <i>Isocrates</i>, formed a Chronological History of <i>Greece</i>,
  beginning with the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>, and ending with the Siege of <i>Perinthus</i>, in
  the twentieth year of <i>Philip</i> the father of <i>Alexander</i> the
  great, that is, eleven years before the fall of the <i>Persian</i>
  Empire: but <a name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> he
  digested things by Generations, and the reckoning by the Olympiads, or by
  any other <i>Æra</i>, was not yet in use among the <i>Greeks</i>. The
  <i>Arundelian</i> Marbles were composed sixty years after the death of
  <i>Alexander</i> the great (<i>An.</i> 4. <i>Olymp.</i> 128.) and yet
  mention not the Olympiads, nor any other standing <i>Æra</i>, but reckon
  backwards from the time then present. But Chronology was now reduced to a
  reckoning by Years; and in the next Olympiad <i>Timæus Siculus</i>
  improved it: for he wrote a History in Several books, down to his own
  times, according to the Olympiads; comparing the <i>Ephori</i>, the Kings
  of <i>Sparta</i>, the Archons of <i>Athens</i>, and the Priestesses of
  <i>Argos</i> with the Olympic Victors, so as to make the Olympiads, and
  the Genealogies and Successions of Kings and Priestesses, and the
  Poetical Histories suit with one another, according to the best of his
  judgment: and where he left off, <i>Polybius</i> began, and carried on
  the History. <i>Eratosthenes</i> wrote above an hundred years after the
  death of <i>Alexander</i> the great: He was followed by
  <i>Apollodorus</i>; and these two have been followed ever since by
  Chronologers.</p>

  <p>But how uncertain their Chronology is, and how doubtful it was reputed
  by the <i>Greeks</i> of those times, may be understood by these passages
  of <i>Plutarch</i>. <i>Some reckon </i>Lycurgus, saith he, <a
  name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> <i>contemporary to
  </i>Iphitus<i>, and to have been his companion in ordering the Olympic
  festivals, amongst whom was </i>Aristotle<i> the Philosopher; arguing
  from the Olympic Disc, which had the name of </i>Lycurgus<i> upon it.
  Others supputing the times by the Kings of </i>Lacedæmon<i>, as
  </i>Eratosthenes<i> and </i>Apollodorus<i>, affirm that he was not a few
  years older than the first Olympiad.</i> He began to flourish in the 17th
  or 18th Olympiad, and at length <i>Aristotle</i> made him as old as the
  first Olympiad; and so did <i>Epaminondas</i>, as he is cited by
  <i>Ælian</i> and <i>Plutarch</i>: and then <i>Eratosthenes</i>,
  <i>Apollodorus</i>, and their followers, made him above an hundred years
  older.</p>

  <p>And in another place <i>Plutarch</i> <a name="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> tells us: <i>The Congress of
  </i>Solon<i> with </i>Cr&#339;sus<i>, some think they can confute by
  Chronology. But a History so illustrious, and verified by so many
  witnesses, and which is more, so agreeable to the manners of
  </i>Solon<i>, and worthy of the greatness of his mind, and of his wisdom,
  I cannot persuade my self to reject because of some Chronological Canons,
  as they call them, which hundreds of authors correcting, have not yet
  been able to constitute any thing certain, in which they could agree
  amongst themselves, about repugnancies.</i></p>

  <p>As for the Chronology of the <i>Latines</i>, that is still more
  uncertain. <i>Plutarch</i> <a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> represents great uncertainties in the
  Originals of <i>Rome</i>, and so doth <i>Servius</i> <a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>. The old Records of the <i>Latines</i>
  were burnt <a name="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> by the
  <i>Gauls</i>, an hundred and twenty years after the Regifuge, and
  sixty-four years before the death of <i>Alexander</i> the great: and
  <i>Quintus Fabius Pictor</i>, <a name="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> the oldest Historian of the
  <i>Latines</i>, lived an hundred years later than that King, and took
  almost all things from <i>Diocles Peparethius</i>, a <i>Greek</i>. The
  Chronologers of <i>Gallia</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Germany</i>,
  <i>Scythia</i>, <i>Swedeland</i>, <i>Britain</i> and <i>Ireland</i> are
  of a date still later; for <i>Scythia</i> beyond the <i>Danube</i> had no
  letters, 'till <i>Ulphilas</i> their Bishop formed them; which was about
  six hundred years after the death of <i>Alexander</i> the great: and
  <i>Germany</i> had none 'till it received them, from the western Empire
  of the <i>Latines</i>, above seven hundred years after the death of that
  King. The <i>Hunns</i>, had none in the days of <i>Procopius</i>, who
  flourished 850 years after the death of that King: and <i>Sweden</i> and
  <i>Norway</i> received them still later. And things said to be done above
  one or two hundred years before the use of letters, are of little
  credit.</p>

  <p><i>Diodorus</i>, <a name="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> in
  the beginning of his History tells us, that he did not define by any
  certain space the times preceding the <i>Trojan</i> War, because he had
  no certain foundation to rely upon: but from the <i>Trojan</i> war,
  according to the reckoning of <i>Apollodorus</i>, whom he followed, there
  were eighty years to the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>; and that from that Period to the first Olympiad,
  there were three hundred and twenty eight years, computing the times from
  the Kings of the <i>Lacedæmonians</i>. <i>Apollodorus</i> followed
  <i>Eratosthenes</i>, and both of them followed <i>Thucydides</i>, in
  reckoning eighty years from the <i>Trojan</i> war to the Return of the
  <i>Heraclides</i>: but in reckoning 328 years from that Return to the
  first Olympiad, <i>Diodorus</i> tells us, that the times were computed
  from the Kings of the <i>Lacedæmonians</i>; and <i>Plutarch</i> <a
  name="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> tells us, that
  <i>Apollodorus</i>, <i>Eratosthenes</i> and others followed that
  computation: and since this reckoning is still received by Chronologers,
  and was gathered by computing the times from the Kings of the
  <i>Lacedæmonians</i>, that is from their number, let us re-examin that
  Computation.</p>

  <p>The <i>Egyptians</i> reckoned the Reigns of Kings equipollent to
  Generations of men, and three Generations to an hundred years, as above;
  and so did the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latines</i>: and accordingly they
  have made their Kings Reign one with another thirty and three years
  a-piece, and above. For they make the seven Kings of <i>Rome</i> who
  preceded the Consuls to have Reigned 244 years, which is 35 years
  a-piece: and the first twelve Kings of <i>Sicyon</i>, <i>Ægialeus</i>,
  <i>Europs</i>, &amp;c. to have Reigned 529 years, which is 44 years
  a-piece: and the first eight Kings of <i>Argos</i>, <i>Inachus</i>,
  <i>Phoroneus</i>, &amp;c. to have Reigned 371 years, which is above 46
  years a-piece: and between the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>, and the end of the first <i>Messenian</i> war, the
  ten Kings of <i>Sparta</i> in one Race; <i>Eurysthenes</i>, <i>Agis</i>,
  <i>Echestratus</i>, <i>Labotas</i>, <i>Doryagus</i>, <i>Agesilaus</i>,
  <i>Archelaus</i>, <i>Teleclus</i>, <i>Alcamenes</i>, and
  <i>Polydorus</i>: the nine in the other Race; <i>Procles</i>,
  <i>Sous</i>, <i>Eurypon</i>, <i>Prytanis</i>, <i>Eunomus</i>,
  <i>Polydectes</i>, <i>Charilaus</i>, <i>Nicander</i>, <i>Theopompus</i>:
  the ten Kings of <i>Messene</i>; <i>Cresphontes</i>, <i>Epytus</i>,
  <i>Glaucus</i>, <i>Isthmius</i>, <i>Dotadas</i>, <i>Sibotas</i>,
  <i>Phintas</i>, <i>Antiochus</i>, <i>Euphaes</i>, <i>Aristodemus</i>: and
  the nine of <i>Arcadia</i>; <i>Cypselus</i>, <i>Olæas</i>,
  <i>Buchalion</i>, <i>Phialus</i>, <i>Simus</i>, <i>Pompus</i>,
  <i>Ægineta</i>, <i>Polymnestor</i>, <i>Æchmis</i>, according to
  Chronologers, took up 379 years: which is 38 years a-piece to the ten
  Kings, and 42 years a-piece to the nine. And the five Kings of the Race
  of <i>Eurysthenes</i>, between the end of the first <i>Messenian</i> war,
  and the beginning of the Reign of <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>;
  <i>Eurycrates</i>, <i>Anaxander</i>, <i>Eurycrates II</i>, <i>Leon</i>,
  <i>Anaxandrides</i>, Reigned 202 years, which is above 40 years
  a-piece.</p>

  <p>Thus the <i>Greek</i> Chronologers, who follow <i>Timæus</i> and
  <i>Eratosthenes</i>, have made the Kings of their several Cities, who
  lived before the times of the <i>Persian</i> Empire, to Reign about 35 or
  40 years a-piece, one with another; which is a length so much beyond the
  course of nature, as is not to be credited. For by the ordinary course of
  nature Kings Reign, one with another, about eighteen or twenty years
  a-piece: and if in some instances they Reign, one with another, five or
  six years longer, in others they Reign as much shorter: eighteen or
  twenty years is a medium. So the eighteen Kings of <i>Judah</i> who
  succeeded <i>Solomon</i>, Reigned 390 years, which is one with another 22
  years a-piece. The fifteen Kings of <i>Israel</i> after <i>Solomon</i>,
  Reigned 259 years, which is 17¼ years a-piece. The eighteen Kings of
  <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Nabonassar</i> &amp;c. Reigned 209 years, which is
  11&#x2154; years a-piece. The ten Kings of <i>Persia</i>; <i>Cyrus</i>,
  <i>Cambyses</i>, &amp;c. Reigned 208 years, which is almost 21 years a
  piece. The sixteen Successors of <i>Alexander</i> the great, and of his
  brother and son in <i>Syria</i>; <i>Seleucus</i>, <i>Antiochus Soter</i>,
  &amp;c. Reigned 244 years, after the breaking of that Monarchy into
  various Kingdoms, which is 15¼ years a-piece. The eleven Kings of
  <i>Egypt</i>; <i>Ptolomæus Lagi</i>, &amp;c. Reigned 277 years, counted
  from the same Period, which is 25 years a-piece. The eight in
  <i>Macedonia</i>; <i>Cassander</i>, &amp;c. Reigned 138 years, which is
  17¼ years a-piece. The thirty Kings of <i>England</i>; <i>William</i> the
  Conqueror, <i>William Rufus</i>, &amp;c. Reigned 648 years, which is 21½
  years a-piece. The first twenty four Kings of <i>France</i>;
  <i>Pharamundus</i>, &amp;c. Reigned 458 years, which is 19 years a-piece:
  the next twenty four Kings of <i>France</i>; <i>Ludovicus Balbus</i>,
  &amp;c. 451 years, which is 18¾ years a-piece: the next fifteen,
  <i>Philip Valesius</i>, &amp;c. 315 years, which is 21 years a-piece: and
  all the sixty three Kings of <i>France</i>, 1224 years, which is 19½
  years a-piece. Generations from father to son, may be reckoned one with
  another at about 33 or 34 years a-piece, or about three Generations to an
  hundred years: but if the reckoning proceed by the eldest sons, they are
  shorter, so that three of them may be reckoned at about 75 or 80 years:
  and the Reigns of Kings are still shorter, because Kings are succeeded
  not only by their eldest sons, but sometimes by their brothers, and
  sometimes they are slain or deposed; and succeeded by others of an equal
  or greater age, especially in elective or turbulent Kingdoms. In the
  later Ages, since Chronology hath been exact, there is scarce an instance
  to be found of ten Kings Reigning any where in continual Succession above
  260 years: but <i>Timæus</i> and his followers, and I think also some of
  his Predecessors, after the example of the <i>Egyptians</i>, have taken
  the Reigns of Kings for Generations, and reckoned three Generations to an
  hundred, and sometimes to an hundred and twenty years; and founded the
  Technical Chronology of the <i>Greeks</i> upon this way of reckoning. Let
  the reckoning be reduced to the course of nature, by putting the Reigns
  of Kings one with another, at about eighteen or twenty years a-piece: and
  the ten Kings of <i>Sparta</i> by one Race, the nine by another Race, the
  ten Kings of <i>Messene</i>, and the nine of <i>Arcadia</i>, above
  mentioned, between the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>, and the end of the first <i>Messenian</i> war, will
  scarce take up above 180 or 190 years: whereas according to Chronologers
  they took up 379 years.</p>

  <p>For confirming this reckoning, I may add another argument.
  <i>Euryleon</i> the son of <i>Ægeus</i>, <a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> commanded the main body of the
  <i>Messenians</i> in the fifth year of the first <i>Messenian</i> war,
  and was in the fifth Generation from <i>Oiolicus</i> the son
  <i>Theras</i>, the brother-in-law of <i>Aristodemus</i>, and tutor to his
  sons <i>Eurysthenes</i> and <i>Procles</i>, as <i>Pausanias</i> <a
  name="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> relates: and by
  consequence, from the return of the <i>Heraclides</i>, which was in the
  days of <i>Theras</i>, to the battle which was in the fifth year of this
  war, there were six Generations, which, as I conceive, being for the most
  part by the eldest sons, will scarce exceed thirty years to a Generation;
  and so may amount unto 170 or 180 years. That war lasted 19 or 20 years:
  add the last 15 years, and there will be about 190 years to the end of
  that war: whereas the followers of <i>Timæus</i> make it about 379 years,
  which is above sixty years to a Generation.</p>

  <p>By these arguments, Chronologers have lengthned the time, between the
  return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i> and the first
  <i>Messenian</i> war, adding to it about 190 years: and they have also
  lengthned the time, between that war and the rise of the <i>Persian</i>
  Empire. For in the Race of the <i>Spartan</i> Kings, descended from
  <i>Eurysthenes</i>; after <i>Polydorus</i>, reigned <a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> these Kings, <i>Eurycrates</i>,
  <i>Anaxander</i>, <i>Eurycratides</i>, <i>Leon</i>, <i>Anaxandrides</i>,
  <i>Clomenes</i>, <i>Leonidas</i>, &amp;c. And in the other Race descended
  from <i>Procles</i>; after <i>Theopompus</i>, reigned <a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> these, <i>Anaxandrides</i>,
  <i>Archidemus</i>, <i>Anaxileus</i>, <i>Leutychides</i>,
  <i>Hippocratides</i>, <i>Ariston</i>, <i>Demaratus</i>,
  <i>Leutychides</i> II. &amp;c. according to <i>Herodotus</i>. These Kings
  reigned 'till the sixth year of <i>Xerxes</i>, in which <i>Leonidas</i>
  was slain by the <i>Persians</i> at <i>Thermopylæ</i>; and
  <i>Leutychides</i> II. soon after, flying from <i>Sparta</i> to
  <i>Tegea</i>, died there. The seven Reigns of the Kings of <i>Sparta</i>,
  which follow <i>Polydorus</i>, being added to the ten Reigns above
  mentioned, which began with that of <i>Eurysthenes</i>; make up seventeen
  Reigns of Kings, between the return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i> and the sixth year of <i>Xerxes</i>: and the eight
  Reigns following <i>Theopompus</i>, being added to the nine Reigns above
  mentioned, which began with that of <i>Procles</i>, make up also
  seventeen Reigns: and these seventeen Reigns, at twenty years a-piece one
  with another, amount unto three hundred and forty years. Count these 340
  years upwards from the sixth year of <i>Xerxes</i>, and one or two years
  more for the war of the <i>Heraclides</i>, and Reign of
  <i>Aristodemus</i>, the father of <i>Eurysthenes</i> and <i>Procles</i>;
  and they will place the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>, 159 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>, and 46
  years before the first Olympiad, in which <i>Coræbus</i> was victor. But
  the followers of <i>Timæus</i> have placed this Return two hundred and
  eighty years earlier. Now this being the computation upon which the
  <i>Greeks</i>, as you have heard from <i>Diodorus</i> and
  <i>Plutarch</i>, have founded the Chronology of their Kingdoms, which
  were ancienter than the <i>Persian</i> Empire; that Chronology is to be
  rectified, by shortening the times which preceded the death of
  <i>Cyrus</i>, in the proportion of almost two to one; for the times which
  follow the death of <i>Cyrus</i> are not much amiss.</p>

  <p>The Artificial Chronologers, have made <i>Lycurgus</i>, the
  legislator, as old as <i>Iphitus</i>, the restorer of the Olympiads; and
  <i>Iphitus</i>, an hundred and twelve years, older than the first
  Olympiad: and, to help out the Hypothesis, they have feigned twenty eight
  Olympiads older than the first Olympiad, wherein <i>Coræbus</i> was
  victor. But these things were feigned, after the days of
  <i>Thucydides</i> and <i>Plato</i>: for <i>Socrates</i> died three years
  after the end of the <i>Peloponnesian</i> war, and <i>Plato</i> <a
  name="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> introduceth him saying,
  that <i>the institutions of </i>Lycurgus<i> were but of three hundred
  years standing, or not much more</i>. And <a name="NtA_29"
  href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> <i>Thucydides</i>, in the reading
  followed by <i>Stephanus</i>, saith, that <i>the </i>Lacedæmonians<i>,
  had from ancient times used good </i> <i> laws, and been free from
  tyranny; and that from the time that they had used one and the same
  administration of their commonwealth, to the end of the
  </i>Peloponnesian<i> war, there were three hundred years and a few
  more</i>. Count three hundred years back from the end of the
  <i>Peloponnesian</i> war, and they will place the Legislature of
  <i>Lycurgus</i> upon the 19th Olympiad. And, according to
  <i>Socrates</i>, it might be upon the 22d or 23d. <i>Athenæus</i> <a
  name="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> tells us out of ancient
  authors (<i>Hellanicus</i>, <i>Sosimus</i> and <i>Hieronymus</i>) that
  <i>Lycurgus</i> the Legislator, was contemporary to <i>Terpander</i> the
  Musician; and that <i>Terpander</i> was the first man who got the victory
  in the <i>Carnea</i>, in a solemnity of music instituted in those
  festivals in the 26th Olympiad. He overcame four times in those
  <i>Pythic</i> games, and therefore lived at least 'till the 29th
  Olympiad: and beginning to flourish in the days of <i>Lycurgus</i>, it is
  not likely that <i>Lycurgus</i> began to flourish, much before the 18th
  Olympiad. The name of <i>Lycurgus</i> being on the Olympic Disc,
  <i>Aristotle</i> concluded thence, that <i>Lycurgus</i> was the companion
  of <i>Iphitus</i>, in restoring the Olympic games: and this argument
  might be the ground of the opinion of Chronologers, that <i>Lycurgus</i>
  and <i>Iphitus</i> were contemporary. But <i>Iphitus</i> did not restore
  all the Olympic games. He <a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> restored indeed the Racing in the first
  Olympiad, <i>Coræbus</i> being victor. In the 14th Olympiad, the double
  <i>stadium</i> was added, <i>Hypænus</i> being victor. And in the 18th
  Olympiad the <i>Quinquertium</i> and Wrestling were added, <i>Lampus</i>
  and <i>Eurybatus</i>, two <i>Spartans</i>, being victors: And the Disc
  was one of the games of the <i>Quinquertium</i>. <a name="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> <i>Pausanias</i> tells us that there
  were three Discs kept in the Olympic treasury at <i>Altis</i>: these
  therefore having the name of <i>Lycurgus</i> upon them, shew that they
  were given by him, at the institution of the <i>Quinquertium</i>, in the
  18th Olympiad. Now <i>Polydectes</i> King of <i>Sparta</i>, being slain
  before the birth of his son <i>Charillus</i> or <i>Charilaus</i>, left
  the Kingdom to <i>Lycurgus</i> his brother; and <i>Lycurgus</i>, upon the
  birth of <i>Charillus</i>, became tutor to the child; and after about
  eight months travelled into <i>Crete</i> and <i>Asia</i>, till the child
  grew up, and brought back with him the poems of <i>Homer</i>; and soon
  after published his laws, suppose upon the 22d or 23d Olympiad; for he
  was then growing old: and <i>Terpander</i> was a Lyric Poet, and began to
  flourish about this time; for <a name="NtA_33"
  href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> he imitated <i>Orpheus</i> and
  <i>Homer</i>, and sung <i>Homer's</i> verses and his own, and wrote the
  laws of <i>Lycurgus</i> in verse, and was victor in the <i>Pythic</i>
  games in the 26th Olympiad, as above. He was the first who distinguished
  the modes of Lyric music by several names. <i>Ardalus</i> and
  <i>Clonas</i> soon after did the like for wind music: and from
  henceforward, by the encouragement of the <i>Pythic</i> games, now
  instituted, several eminent Musicians and Poets flourished in
  <i>Greece</i>: as <i>Archilochus</i>, <i>Eumelus Corinthius</i>,
  <i>Polymnestus</i>, <i>Thaletas</i>, <i>Xenodemus</i>, <i>Xenocritus</i>,
  <i>Sacadas</i>, <i>Tyrtæus</i>, <i>Tlesilla</i>, <i>Rhianus</i>,
  <i>Alcman</i>, <i>Arion</i>, <i>Stesichorus</i>, <i>Mimnermnus</i>,
  <i>Alcæus</i>, <i>Sappho</i>, <i>Theognis</i>, <i>Anacreon</i>,
  <i>Ibycus</i>, <i>Simonides</i>, <i>Æschylus</i>, <i>Pindar</i>, by whom
  the Music and Poetry of the <i>Greeks</i> were brought to perfection.</p>

  <p><i>Lycurgus</i>, published his laws in the Reign of <i>Agesilaus</i>,
  the son and successor of <i>Doryagus</i>, in the Race of the Kings of
  <i>Sparta</i> descended from <i>Eurysthenes</i>. From the Return of the
  <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i>, to the end of the Reign of
  <i>Agesilaus</i>, there were six Reigns: and from the same Return to the
  end of the Reign of <i>Polydectes</i>, in the Race of the <i>Spartan</i>
  Kings descended from <i>Procles</i>, there were also six Reigns: and
  these Reigns, at twenty years a-piece one with another, amount unto 120
  years; besides the short Reign of <i>Aristodemus</i>, the father of
  <i>Eurysthenes</i> and <i>Procles</i>, which might amount to a year or
  two: for <i>Aristodemus</i> came to the crown, as <a name="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> <i>Herodotus</i> and the
  <i>Lacedæmonians</i> themselves affirmed. The times of the deaths of
  <i>Agesilaus</i> and <i>Polydectes</i> are not certainly known: but it
  may be presumed that <i>Lycurgus</i> did not meddle with the Olympic
  games before he came to the Kingdom; and therefore <i>Polydectes</i> died
  in the beginning of the 18th Olympiad, or but a very little before. If it
  may be supposed that the 20th Olympiad was in, or very near to the middle
  time between the deaths of the two Kings <i>Polydectes</i> and
  <i>Agesilaus</i>, and from thence be counted upwards the aforesaid 120
  years, and one year more for the Reign of <i>Aristodemus</i>; the
  reckoning will place the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i>, about 45 years
  before the beginning of the Olympiads.</p>

  <p><i>Iphitus</i>, who restored the Olympic games, <a name="NtA_35"
  href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> was descended from <i>Oxylus</i>, the
  son of <i>Hæmon</i>, the son of <i>Thoas</i>, the son of <i>Andræmon</i>:
  <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Andræmon</i> married two sisters: <i>Thoas</i>
  warred at <i>Troy</i>: <i>Oxylus</i> returned into <i>Peloponnesus</i>
  with the <i>Heraclides</i>. In this return he commanded the body of the
  <i>Ætolians</i>, and recovered <i>Elea</i>; <a name="NtA_36"
  href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> from whence his ancestor <i>Ætolus</i>,
  the son of <i>Endymion</i>, the son of <i>Aethlius</i>, had been driven
  by <i>Salmoneus</i> the grandson of <i>Hellen</i>. By the friendship of
  the <i>Heraclides</i>, <i>Oxylus</i> had the care of the Olympic Temple
  committed to him: and the <i>Heraclides</i>, for his service done them,
  granted further upon oath that the country of the <i>Eleans</i> should be
  free from invasions, and be defended by them from all armed force: And
  when the <i>Eleans</i> were thus consecrated, <i>Oxylus</i> restored the
  Olympic games: and after they had been again intermitted, <i>Iphitus</i>
  their King <a name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> restored
  them, and made them quadrennial. <i>Iphitus</i> is by some reckoned the
  son of <i>Hæmon</i>, by others the son of <i>Praxonidas</i>, the son of
  <i>Hæmon</i>: but <i>Hæmon</i> being the father of <i>Oxylus</i>, I would
  reckon <i>Iphitus</i> the son of <i>Praxonidas</i>, the son of
  <i>Oxylus</i>, the son of <i>Hæmon</i>. And by this reckoning the Return
  of the <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i> will be two Generations
  by the eldest sons, or about 52 years, before the Olympiads.</p>

  <p><i>Pausanias</i> <a name="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
  represents that <i>Melas</i> the son of <i>Antissus</i>, of the posterity
  of <i>Gonussa</i> the daughter of <i>Sicyon</i>, was not above six
  Generations older than <i>Cypselus</i> King of <i>Corinth</i>; and that
  he was contemporary to <i>Aletes</i>, who returned with the
  <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i>. The Reign of <i>Cypselus</i>
  began <i>An.</i> 2, Olymp. 31, according to Chronologers; and six
  Generations, at about 30 years to a Generation, amount unto 180 years.
  Count those years backwards from <i>An.</i> 2, Olymp. 31, and they will
  place the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i> 58
  years before the first Olympiad. But it might not be so early, if the
  Reign of <i>Cypselus</i> began three or four Olympiads later; for he
  reigned before the <i>Persian</i> Empire began.</p>

  <p><i>Hercules</i> the <i>Argonaut</i> was the father of <i>Hyllus</i>;
  the father of <i>Cleodius</i>; the father of <i>Aristomachus</i>; the
  father of <i>Temenus</i>, <i>Cresphontes</i>, and <i>Aristodemus</i>, who
  led the <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i> and <i>Eurystheus</i>,
  who was of the same age with <i>Hercules</i>, was slain in the first
  attempt of the <i>Heraclides</i> to return: <i>Hyllus</i> was slain in
  the second attempt, <i>Cleodius</i> in the third attempt,
  <i>Aristomachus</i> in the fourth attempt, and <i>Aristodemus</i> died as
  soon as they were returned, and left the Kingdom of <i>Sparta</i> to his
  sons <i>Eurysthenes</i> and <i>Procles</i>. Whence their Return was four
  Generations later than the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition: And these
  Generations were short ones, being by the chief of the family, and suit
  with the reckoning of <i>Thucydides</i> and the Ancients, that the taking
  of <i>Troy</i> was about 75 or eighty years before the return of the
  <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i>; and the <i>Argonautic</i>
  expedition one Generation earlier than the taking of <i>Troy</i>. Count
  therefore eighty years backward from the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i>
  into <i>Peloponnesus</i> to the <i>Trojan</i> war, and the taking of
  <i>Troy</i> will be about 76 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>: And
  the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition, which was one Generation earlier, will
  be about 43 years after it. From the taking of <i>Troy</i> to the Return
  of the <i>Heraclides</i>, could scarce be more than eighty years, because
  <i>Orestes</i> the son of <i>Agamemnon</i> was a youth at the taking of
  <i>Troy</i>, and his sons <i>Penthilus</i> and <i>Tisamenus</i> lived
  till the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Æsculapius</i> and <i>Hercules</i> were <i>Argonauts</i>, and
  <i>Hippocrates</i> was the eighteenth inclusively by the father's side
  from <i>Æsculapius</i>, and the nineteenth from <i>Hercules</i> by the
  mother's side: and because these Generations, being taken notice of by
  writers, were most probably by the principal of the family, and so for
  the most part by the eldest sons; we may reckon about 28 or at the most
  about 30 years to a Generation. And thus the seventeen intervals by the
  father's side, and eighteen by the mother's, will at a middle reckoning
  amount unto about 507 years: which counted backwards from the beginning
  of the <i>Peloponnesian</i> war, at which time <i>Hippocrates</i> began
  to flourish, will reach up to the 43d year after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>, and there place the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Romans</i> conquered the <i>Carthaginians</i>, the
  Archives of <i>Carthage</i> came into their hands: And thence
  <i>Appian</i>, in his history of the <i>Punic</i> wars, tells in round
  numbers that <i>Carthage</i> stood seven hundred years: and <a
  name="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> <i>Solinus</i> adds the
  odd number of years in these words: <i>Adrymeto atque Carthagini author
  est a Tyro populus. Urbem istam, ut Cato in Oratione Senatoria autumat;
  cum rex Hiarbas rerum in Libya potiretur, Elissa mulier extruxit, domo
  Ph&#339;nix &amp; Carthadam dixit, quod Ph&#339;nicum ore exprimit
  civitatem novam; mox sermone verso Carthago dicta est, quæ post annos
  septingentos triginta septem exciditur quam fuerat extructa</i>.
  <i>Elissa</i> was <i>Dido</i>, and <i>Carthage</i> was destroyed in the
  Consulship of <i>Lentulus</i> and <i>Mummius</i>, in the year of the
  <i>Julian Period</i> 4568; from whence count backwards <i>737</i> years,
  and the <i>Encænia</i> or Dedication of the City, will fall upon the 16th
  year of <i>Pygmalion</i>, the brother of <i>Dido</i>, and King of
  <i>Tyre</i>. She fled in the seventh year of <i>Pygmalion</i>, but the
  <i>Æra</i> of the City began with its <i>Encænia</i>. Now <i>Virgil</i>,
  and his Scholiast <i>Servius</i>, who might have some things from the
  archives of <i>Tyre</i> and <i>Cyprus</i>, as well as from those of
  <i>Carthage</i>, relate that <i>Teucer</i> came from the war of
  <i>Troy</i> to <i>Cyprus</i>, in the days of <i>Dido</i>, a little before
  the Reign of her brother <i>Pygmalion</i>; and, in conjunction with her
  father, seized <i>Cyprus</i>, and ejected <i>Cinyras</i>: and the Marbles
  say that <i>Teucer</i> came to <i>Cyprus</i> seven years after the
  destruction of <i>Troy</i>, and built <i>Salamis</i>; and
  <i>Apollodorus</i>, that <i>Cinyras</i> married <i>Metharme</i> the
  daughter of <i>Pygmalion</i>, and built <i>Paphos</i>. Therefore, if the
  <i>Romans</i>, in the days of <i>Augustus</i>, followed not altogether
  the artificial Chronology of <i>Eratosthenes</i>, but had these things
  from the records of <i>Carthage</i>, <i>Cyprus</i>, or <i>Tyre</i>; the
  arrival of <i>Teucer</i> at <i>Cyprus</i> will be in the Reign of the
  predecessor of <i>Pygmalion</i>: and by consequence the destruction of
  <i>Troy</i>, about 76 years later than the death of <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Dionysius Halicarnassensis</i> <a name="NtA_40"
  href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> tells us, that in the time of the
  <i>Trojan</i> war, <i>Latinus</i> was King of the <i>Aborigines</i> in
  <i>Italy</i>, and that in the sixteenth Age after that war,
  <i>Romulus</i> built <i>Rome</i>. By Ages he means Reigns of Kings: for
  after <i>Latinus</i> he names sixteen Kings of the <i>Latines</i>, the
  last of which was <i>Numitor</i>, in whose days <i>Romulus</i> built
  <i>Rome</i>: for <i>Romulus</i> was contemporary to <i>Numitor</i>, and
  after him <i>Dionysius</i> and others reckon six Kings more over
  <i>Rome</i>, to the beginning of the Consuls. Now these twenty and two
  Reigns, at about 18 years to a Reign one with another, for many of these
  Kings were slain, took up 396 years; which counted back from the
  consulship of <i>Junius Brutus</i> and <i>Valerius Publicola</i>, the two
  first Consuls, place the <i>Trojan</i> war about 78 years after the death
  of <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

  <p>The expedition of <i>Sesostris</i> was one Generation earlier than the
  <i>Argonautic</i> expedition: for in his return back into <i>Egypt</i> he
  left <i>Æetes</i> in <i>Colchis</i>, and <i>Æetes</i> reigned there 'till
  the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition; and <i>Prometheus</i> was left by
  <i>Sesostris</i> with a body of men at <i>Mount Caucasus</i>, to guard
  that pass, and after thirty years was released by <i>Hercules</i> the
  <i>Argonaut</i>: and <i>Phlyas</i> and <i>Eumedon</i>, the sons of the
  great <i>Bacchus</i>, so the Poets call <i>Sesostris</i>, and of
  <i>Ariadne</i> the daughter of <i>Minos</i>, were <i>Argonauts</i>. At
  the return of <i>Sesostris</i> into <i>Egypt</i>, his brother
  <i>Danaus</i> fled from him into <i>Greece</i> with his fifty daughters,
  in a long ship; after the pattern of which the ship <i>Argo</i> was
  built: and <i>Argus</i>, the son of <i>Danaus</i>, was the master-builder
  thereof. <i>Nauplius</i> the <i>Argonaut</i> was born in <i>Greece</i>,
  of <i>Amymone</i>, one of the daughters of <i>Danaus</i>, and of
  <i>Neptune</i>, the brother and admiral of <i>Sesostris</i>: And two
  others of the daughters of <i>Danaus</i> married <i>Archander</i> and
  <i>Archilites</i>, the sons of <i>Achæus</i>, the son of <i>Creusa</i>,
  the daughter of <i>Erechtheus</i> King of <i>Athens</i>: and therefore
  the daughters of <i>Danaus</i> were three Generations younger than
  <i>Erechtheus</i>; and by consequence contemporary to <i>Theseus</i> the
  son of <i>Ægeus</i>, the adopted son of <i>Pandion</i>, the son of
  <i>Erechtheus</i>. <i>Theseus</i>, in the time of the <i>Argonautic</i>
  expedition, was of about 50 years of age, and so was born about the 33d
  year of <i>Solomon</i>: for he stole <i>Helena</i> <a name="NtA_41"
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> just before that expedition, being then
  50 years old, and she but seven, or as some say ten. <i>Pirithous</i> the
  son of <i>Ixion</i> helped <i>Theseus</i> to steal <i>Helena</i>, and
  then <a name="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> <i>Theseus</i>
  went with <i>Pirithous</i> to steal <i>Persephone</i>, the daughter of
  <i>Aidoneus</i>, or <i>Orcus</i>, King of the <i>Molossians</i>, and was
  taken in the action: and whilst he lay in prison, <i>Castor</i> and
  <i>Pollux</i> returning from the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition, released
  their sister <i>Helena</i>, and captivated <i>Æthra</i> the mother of
  <i>Theseus</i>. Now the daughters of <i>Danaus</i> being contemporary to
  <i>Theseus</i>, and some of their sons being <i>Argonauts</i>,
  <i>Danaus</i> with his daughters fled from his brother <i>Sesostris</i>
  into <i>Greece</i> about one Generation before the <i>Argonautic</i>
  expedition; and therefore <i>Sesostris</i> returned into <i>Egypt</i> in
  the Reign of <i>Rehoboam</i>. He came out of <i>Egypt</i> in the fifth
  year of <i>Rehoboam</i>, <a name="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and spent nine years in that
  expedition, against the Eastern Nations and <i>Greece</i>; and therefore
  returned back into <i>Egypt</i>, in the fourteenth year of
  <i>Rehoboam</i>. <i>Sesac</i> and <i>Sesostris</i> were therefore Kings
  of all <i>Egypt</i>, at one and the same time: and they agree not only in
  the time, but also in their actions and conquests. God gave <i>Sesac</i>

  expedition of <i>Sesostris</i>, <i>Josephus</i> <a name="NtA_44"
  href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> tells us that he described the
  expedition of <i>Sesac</i>, and attributed his actions to
  <i>Sesostris</i>, erring only in the name of the King. Corruptions of
  names are frequent in history; <i>Sesostris</i> was otherwise called
  <i>Sesochris</i>, <i>Sesochis</i>, <i>Sesoosis</i>, <i>Sethosis</i>,
  <i>Sesonchis</i>, <i>Sesonchosis</i>. Take away the <i>Greek</i>
  termination, and the names become <i>Sesost</i>, <i>Sesoch</i>,
  <i>Sesoos</i>, <i>Sethos</i>, <i>Sesonch</i>: which names differ very
  little from <i>Sesach</i>. <i>Sesonchis</i> and <i>Sesach</i> differ no
  more than <i>Memphis</i> and <i>Moph</i>, two names of the same city.
  <i>Josephus</i> <a name="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> tells
  us also, from <i>Manetho</i>, that <i>Sethosis</i> was the brother of
  <i>Armais</i>, and that these brothers were otherwise called
  <i>Ægyptus</i> and <i>Danaus</i>; and that upon the return of
  <i>Sethosis</i> or <i>Ægyptus</i>, from his great conquests into
  <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Armais</i> or <i>Danaus</i> fled from him into
  <i>Greece</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Egypt</i> was at first divided into many small Kingdoms, like other
  nations; and grew into one monarchy by degrees: and the father of
  <i>Solomon's</i> Queen, was the first King of <i>Egypt</i>, who came into
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> with an Army: but he only took <i>Gezir</i>, and
  gave it to his daughter. <i>Sesac</i>, the next King, came out of
  <i>Egypt</i> with an army of <i>Libyans</i>, <i>Troglodites</i> and
  <i>Ethiopians</i>, 2 Chron. xii. 3. and therefore was then King of all
  those countries; and we do not read in Scripture, that any former King of
  <i>Egypt</i>; who Reigned over all those nations, came out of
  <i>Egypt</i> with a great army to conquer other countries. The sacred
  history of the <i>Israelites</i>, from the days of <i>Abraham</i> to the
  days of <i>Solomon</i>, admits of no such conqueror. <i>Sesostris</i>
  reigned over all the same nations of the <i>Libyans</i>,
  <i>Troglodites</i> and <i>Ethiopians</i>, and came out of <i>Egypt</i>
  with a great army to conquer other Kingdoms. The Shepherds reigned long
  in the lower part of <i>Egypt</i>, and were expelled thence, just before
  the building of <i>Jerusalem</i> and the Temple; according to
  <i>Manetho</i>; and whilst they Reigned in the lower part of
  <i>Egypt</i>, the upper part thereof was under other Kings: and while
  <i>Egypt</i> was divided into several Kingdoms, there was no room for any
  such King of all <i>Egypt</i> as <i>Sesostris</i>; and no historian makes
  him later than <i>Sesac</i>: and therefore he was one and the same King
  of <i>Egypt</i> with <i>Sesac</i>. This is no new opinion:
  <i>Josephus</i> discovered it when he affirmed that <i>Herodotus</i>
  erred, in ascribing the actions of <i>Sesac</i> to <i>Sesostris</i>, and
  that the error was only in the name of the King: for this is as much as
  to say, that the true name of him who did those things described by
  <i>Herodotus</i>, was <i>Sesac</i>; and that <i>Herodotus</i> erred only
  in calling him <i>Sesostris</i>; or that he was called <i>Sesostris</i>
  by a corruption of his name. Our great Chronologer, <i>Sir John
  Marsham</i>, was also of opinion that <i>Sesostris</i> was <i>Sesac</i>:
  and if this be granted, it is then most certain, that <i>Sesostris</i>
  came out of <i>Egypt</i> in the fifth year of <i>Rehoboam</i> to invade
  the nations, and returned back into <i>Egypt</i> in the 14th year of that
  King; and that <i>Danaus</i> then flying from his brother, came into
  <i>Greece</i> within a year or two after: and the <i>Argonautic</i>
  expedition being one Generation later than that invasion, and than the
  coming of <i>Danaus</i> into <i>Greece</i>, was certainly about 40 or 45
  years later than the death of <i>Solomon</i>. <i>Prometheus</i> stay'd on
  <i>Mount Caucasus</i> <a name="NtA_46" href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
  thirty years, and then was released by <i>Hercules</i>: and therefore the
  <i>Argonautic</i> expedition was thirty years after <i>Prometheus</i> had
  been left on <i>Mount Caucasus</i> by <i>Sesostris</i>, that is, about 44
  years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

  <p>All nations, before the just length of the Solar year was known,
  reckoned months by the course of the moon; and years by the <a
  name="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> returns of winter and
  summer, spring and autumn: and in making Calendars for their Festivals,
  reckoned thirty days to a Lunar month, and twelve Lunar months to a year;
  taking the nearest round numbers: whence came the division of the
  Ecliptic into 360 degrees. So in the time of <i>Noah</i>'s flood, when
  the Moon could not be seen, <i>Noah</i> reckoned thirty days to a month:
  but if the Moon appeared a day or two before the end of the month, <a
  name="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> they began the next month
  with the first day of her appearing: and this was done generally, 'till
  the <i>Egyptians</i> of <i>Thebais</i> found the length of the Solar
  year. So <a name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
  <i>Diodorus</i> tells us that <i>the </i>Egyptians<i> of </i>Thebais<i>
  use no intercalary months, nor subduct any days</i> [from the month]
  <i>as is done by most of the </i>Greeks. And <a name="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> <i>Cicero</i>, <i>est consuetudo

  <p>The ancient Calendar year of the <i>Greeks</i> consisted therefore of
  twelve Lunar months, and every month of thirty days: and these years and
  months they corrected from time to time, by the courses of the Sun and
  Moon, omitting a day or two in the month, as often as they found the
  month too long for the course of the Moon; and adding a month to the
  year, as often as they found the twelve Lunar months too short for the
  return of the four seasons. <i>Cleobulus</i>, <a name="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> one of the seven wise men of
  <i>Greece</i>, alluded to this year of the <i>Greeks</i>, in his Parable
  of one father who had twelve sons, each of which had thirty daughters
  half white and half black: and <i>Thales</i> <a name="NtA_53"
  href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> called the last day of the month <span
  lang="el" title="triakada"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;</span>, the
  thirtieth: and <i>Solon</i> counted the ten last days of the month
  backward from the thirtieth, calling that day <span lang="el" title="enên kai nean"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3BD; &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>, the old and the new, or the last day
  of the old month and the first day of the new: for he introduced months
  of 29 and 30 days alternately, making the thirtieth day of every other
  month to be the first day of the next month.</p>

  <p>To the twelve Lunar months <a name="NtA_54"
  href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> the ancient <i>Greeks</i> added a
  thirteenth, every other year, which made their <i>Dieteris</i>; and
  because this reckoning made their year too long by a month in eight
  years, they omitted an intercalary month once in eight years, which made
  their <i>Octaeteris</i>, one half of which was their <i>Tetraeteris</i>:
  And these Periods seem to have been almost as old as the religions of
  <i>Greece</i>, being used in divers of their <i>Sacra</i>. The <a
  name="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> <i>Octaeteris</i> was the
  <i>Annus magnus</i> of <i>Cadmus</i> and <i>Minos</i>, and seems to have
  been brought into <i>Greece</i> and <i>Crete</i> by the
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>, who came thither with <i>Cadmus</i> and
  <i>Europa</i>, and to have continued 'till after the days of
  <i>Herodotus</i>: for in counting the length of seventy years <a
  name="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>, he reckons thirty days
  to a Lunar month, and twelve such months, or 360 days, to the ordinary
  year, without the intercalary months, and 25 such months to the
  <i>Dieteris</i>: and according to the number of days in the Calendar year
  of the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Demetrius Phalereus</i> had 360 Statues erected
  to him by the <i>Athenians</i>. But the <i>Greeks</i>,
  <i>Cleostratus</i>, <i>Harpalus</i>, and others, to make their months
  agree better with the course of the Moon, in the times of the
  <i>Persian</i> Empire, varied the manner of intercaling the three months
  in the <i>Octaeteris</i>; and <i>Meton</i> found out the Cycle of
  intercaling seven months in nineteen years.</p>

  <p>The Ancient year of the <i>Latines</i> was also Luni-solar; for
  <i>Plutarch</i> <a name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> tells
  us, that the year of <i>Numa</i> consisted of twelve Lunar months, with
  intercalary months to make up what the twelve Lunar months wanted of the
  Solar year. The Ancient year of the <i>Egyptians</i> was also Luni-solar,
  and continued to be so 'till the days of <i>Hyperion</i>, or
  <i>Osiris</i>, a King of <i>Egypt</i>, the father of <i>Helius</i> and
  <i>Selene</i>, or <i>Orus</i> and <i>Bubaste</i>: For the
  <i>Israelites</i> brought this year out of <i>Egypt</i>; and
  <i>Diodorus</i> tells <a name="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>
  us that <i>Ouranus</i> the father of <i>Hyperion</i> used this year, and
  <a name="NtA_59" href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> that in the Temple of
  <i>Osiris</i> the Priests appointed thereunto filled 360 Milk Bowls every
  day: I think he means one Bowl every day, in all 360, to count the number
  of days in the Calendar year, and thereby to find out the difference
  between this and the true Solar year: for the year of 360 days was the
  year, to the end of which they added five days.</p>

  <p>That the <i>Israelites</i> used the Luni-solar year is beyond
  question. Their months began with their new Moons. Their first month was
  called <i>Abib</i>, from the earing of Corn in that month. Their Passover
  was kept upon the fourteenth day of the first month, the Moon being then
  in the full: and if the Corn was not then ripe enough for offering the
  first Fruits, the Festival was put off, by adding an intercalary month to
  the end of the year; and the harvest was got in before the Pentecost, and
  the other Fruits gathered before the Feast of the seventh month.</p>

  <p><i>Simplicius</i> in his commentary <a name="NtA_60"
  href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> on the first of <i>Aristotle</i>'s
  <i>Physical Acroasis</i>, tells us, that <i>some begin the year upon the
  Summer Solstice, as the People of </i>Attica<i>; or upon the Autumnal
  Equinox, as the People of </i>Asia<i>; or in Winter, as the
  </i>Romans<i>; or about the Vernal Equinox, as the </i>Arabians<i> and
  People of </i>Damascus<i>: and the month began, according to some, upon
  the Full Moon, or upon the New.</i> The years of all these Nations were
  therefore Luni-solar, and kept to the four Seasons: and the <i>Roman</i>
  year began at first in Spring, as I seem to gather from the Names of
  their Months, <i>Quintilis</i>, <i>Sextilis</i>, <i>September</i>,
  <i>October</i>, <i>November</i>, <i>December</i>: and the beginning was
  afterwards removed to Winter. The ancient civil year of the
  <i>Assyrians</i> and <i>Babylonians</i> was also Luni-solar: for this
  year was also used by the <i>Samaritans</i>, who came from several parts
  of the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire; and the <i>Jews</i> who came from
  <i>Babylon</i> called the months of their Luni-solar year after the Names
  of the months of the <i>Babylonian</i> year: and <i>Berosus</i> <a
  name="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> tells us that the
  <i>Babylonians</i> celebrated the Feast <i>Sacæa</i> upon the 16th day of
  the month <i>Lous</i>, which was a Lunar month of the <i>Macedonians</i>,
  and kept to one and the same Season of the year: and the <i>Arabians</i>,
  a Nation who peopled <i>Babylon</i>, use Lunar months to this day.
  <i>Suidas</i> <a name="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> tells
  us, that the <i>Sarus</i> of the <i>Chaldeans</i> contains 222 Lunar
  months, which are eighteen years, consisting each of twelve Lunar months,
  besides six intercalary months: and when <a name="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> <i>Cyrus</i> cut the River
  <i>Gindus</i> into 360 Channels, he seems to have alluded unto the number
  of days in the Calendar year of the <i>Medes</i> and <i>Persians</i>: and
  the Emperor <i>Julian</i> <a name="NtA_64"
  href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> writes, <i>For when all other People,
  that I may say it in one word, accommodate their months to the course of
  the Moon, we alone with the </i>Egyptians<i> measure the days of the year
  by the course of the Sun.</i></p>

  <p>At length the <i>Egyptians</i>, for the sake of Navigation, applied
  themselves to observe the Stars; and by their Heliacal Risings and
  Settings found the true Solar year to be five days longer than the
  Calendar year, and therefore added five days to the twelve Calendar
  months; making the Solar year to consist of twelve months and five days.
  <i>Strabo</i> <a name="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> and <a
  name="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> <i>Diodorus</i> ascribe
  this invention to the <i>Egyptians</i> of <i>Thebes</i>. <i>The
  </i>Theban<i> Priests</i>, saith <i>Strabo</i>, <i>are above others said
  to be Astronomers and Philosophers. They invented the reckoning of days
  not by the course of the Moon, but by the course of the Sun. To twelve
  months each of thirty days they add yearly five days.</i> In memory of
  this Emendation of the year they dedicated the <a name="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> five additional days to <i>Osiris</i>,
  <i>Isis</i>, <i>Orus</i> senior, <i>Typhon</i>, and <i>Nephthe</i> the
  wife of <i>Typhon</i>, feigning that those days were added to the year
  when these five Princes were born, that is, in the Reign of
  <i>Ouranus</i>, or <i>Ammon</i>, the father of <i>Sesac</i>: and in <a
  name="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> the Sepulchre of
  <i>Amenophis</i>, who Reigned soon after, they placed a Golden Circle of
  365 cubits in compass, and divided it into 365 equal parts, to represent
  all the days in the year, and noted upon each part the Heliacal Risings
  and Settings of the Stars on that day; which Circle remained there 'till
  the invasion of <i>Egypt</i> by <i>Cambyses</i> King of <i>Persia</i>.
  'Till the Reign of <i>Ouranus</i>, the father of <i>Hyperion</i>, and
  grandfather of <i>Helius</i> and <i>Selene</i>, the <i>Egyptians</i> used
  the old Lunisolar year: but in his Reign, that is, in the Reign of
  <i>Ammon</i>, the father of <i>Osiris</i> or <i>Sesac</i>, and
  grandfather of <i>Orus</i> and <i>Bubaste</i>, the <i>Thebans</i> began
  to apply themselves to Navigation and Astronomy, and by the Heliacal
  Risings and Settings of the Stars determined the length of the Solar
  year; and to the old Calendar year added five days, and dedicated them to
  his five children above mentioned, as their birth days: and in the Reign
  of <i>Amenophis</i>, when by further Observations they had sufficiently
  determined the time of the Solstices, they might place the beginning of
  this new year upon the Vernal Equinox. This year being at length
  propagated into <i>Chaldæa</i>, gave occasion to the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i>; for the years of <i>Nabonassar</i> and those of
  <i>Egypt</i> began on one and the same day, called by them <i>Thoth</i>,
  and were equal and in all respects the same: and the first year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> began on the 26th day of <i>February</i> of the old
  <i>Roman</i> year, seven hundred forty and seven years before the Vulgar
  <i>Æra</i> of <i>Christ</i>, and thirty and three days and five hours
  before the Vernal Equinox, according to the Sun's mean motion; for it is
  not likely that the Equation of the Sun's motion should be known in the
  infancy of Astronomy. Now reckoning that the year of 365 days wants five
  hours and 49 minutes of the Equinoctial year; the beginning of this year
  will move backwards thirty and three days and five hours in 137 years:
  and by consequence this year began at first in <i>Egypt</i> upon the
  Vernal Equinox, according to the Sun's mean motion, 137 years before the
  <i>Æra</i> of <i>Nabonassar</i> began; that is, in the year of the
  <i>Julian</i> Period 3830, or 96 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>:
  and if it began upon the next day after the Vernal Equinox, it might
  begin four years earlier; and about that time ended the Reign of
  <i>Amenophis</i>: for he came not from <i>Susa</i> to the <i>Trojan</i>
  war, but died afterwards in <i>Egypt</i>. This year was received by the
  <i>Persian</i> Empire from the <i>Babylonian</i>; and the <i>Greeks</i>
  also used it in the <i>Æra Philippæa</i>, dated from the Death of
  <i>Alexander</i> the great; and <i>Julius Cæsar</i> corrected it, by
  adding a day in every four years, and made it the year of the
  <i>Romans</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Syncellus</i> tells us, that the five days were added to the old
  year by the last King of the Shepherds: and the difference in time
  between the Reign of this King, and that of <i>Ammon</i>, is but small;
  for the Reign of the Shepherds ended but one Generation, or two, before
  <i>Ammon</i> began to add those days. But the Shepherds minded not Arts
  and Sciences.</p>

  <p>The first month of the Luni-solar year, by reason of the Intercalary
  month, began sometimes a week or a fortnight before the Equinox or
  Solstice, and sometimes as much after it. And this year gave occasion to
  the first Astronomers, who formed the <i>Asterisms</i>, to place the
  Equinoxes and Solstices in the middles of the Constellations of
  <i>Aries</i>, <i>Cancer</i>, <i>Chelæ</i>, and <i>Capricorn</i>.
  <i>Achilles Tatius</i> <a name="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>
  tells us, that <i>some antiently placed the Solstice in the beginning of
  </i>Cancer<i>, others in the eighth degree of </i>Cancer<i>, others about
  the twelfth degree, and others about the fifteenth degree thereof.</i>
  This variety of opinions proceeded from the precession of the Equinox,
  then not known to the <i>Greeks</i>. When the Sphere was first formed,
  the Solstice was in the fifteenth degree or middle of the Constellation
  of <i>Cancer</i>: then it came into the twelfth, eighth, fourth, and
  first degree successively. <i>Eudoxus</i>, who flourished about sixty
  years after <i>Meton</i>, and an hundred years before <i>Aratus</i>, in
  describing the Sphere of the Ancients, placed the Solstices and Equinoxes
  in the middles of the Constellations of <i>Aries</i>, <i>Cancer</i>,
  <i>Chelæ</i>, and <i>Capricorn</i>, as is affirmed by <a name="NtA_70"
  href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> <i>Hipparchus Bithynus</i>; and appears
  also by the Description of the Equinoctial and Tropical Circles in
  <i>Aratus</i>, <a name="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> who
  copied after <i>Eudoxus</i>; and by the positions of the <i>Colures</i>
  of the Equinoxes and Solstices, which in the Sphere of <i>Eudoxus</i>,
  described by <i>Hipparchus</i>, went through the middles of those
  Constellations. For <i>Hipparchus</i> tells us, that <i>Eudoxus</i> drew
  the <i>Colure</i> of the Solstices, through the middle of the <i>great
  Bear</i>, and the middle of <i>Cancer</i>, and the neck of <i>Hydrus</i>,
  and the Star between the Poop and Mast of <i>Argo</i>, and the Tayl of
  the <i>South Fish</i>, and through the middle of <i>Capricorn</i>, and of
  <i>Sagitta</i>, and through the neck and right wing of the <i>Swan</i>,
  and the left hand of <i>Cepheus</i>; and that he drew the Equinoctial
  <i>Colure</i>, through the left hand of <i>Arctophylax</i>, and along the
  middle of his Body, and cross the middle of <i>Chelæ</i>, and through the
  right hand and fore-knee of the <i>Centaur</i>, and through the flexure
  of <i>Eridanus</i> and head of <i>Cetus</i>, and the back of <i>Aries</i>
  a-cross, and through the head and right hand of <i>Perseus</i>.</p>

  &#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span> the
  <i>Asterisms</i>, as the ancient Author of <i>Gigantomachia</i>, cited by
  <a name="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> <i>Clemens
  Alexandrinus</i> informs us: for <i>Chiron</i> was a practical
  Astronomer, as may be there understood also of his daughter <i>Hippo</i>:
  and <i>Musæus</i>, the son of <i>Eumolpus</i> and master of
  <i>Orpheus</i>, and one of the <i>Argonauts</i>, <a name="NtA_73"
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> made a Sphere, and is reputed the first
  among the <i>Greeks</i> who made one: and the Sphere it self shews that
  it was delineated in the time of the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition; for
  that expedition is delineated in the <i>Asterisms</i>, together with
  several other ancienter Histories of the <i>Greeks</i>, and without any
  thing later. There's the golden <i>RAM</i>, the ensign of the Vessel in
  which <i>Phryxus</i> fled to <i>Colchis</i>; the <i>BULL</i> with brazen
  hoofs tamed by <i>Jason</i>; and the <i>TWINS</i>, <i>CASTOR</i> and
  <i>POLLUX</i>, two of the <i>Argonauts</i>, with the <i>SWAN</i> of
  <i>Leda</i> their mother. There's the Ship <i>ARGO</i>, and <i>HYDRUS</i>
  the watchful Dragon; with <i>Medea</i>'s <i>CUP</i>, and a <i>RAVEN</i>
  upon its Carcass, the Symbol of Death. There's <i>CHIRON</i> the master
  of <i>Jason</i>, with his <i>ALTAR</i> and <i>SACRIFICE</i>. There's the
  <i>Argonaut</i> <i>HERCULES</i> with his <i>DART</i> and <i>VULTURE</i>
  falling down; and the <i>DRAGON</i>, <i>CRAB</i> and <i>LION</i>, whom he
  slew; and the <i>HARP</i> of the <i>Argonaut</i> <i>Orpheus</i>. All
  these relate to the <i>Argonauts</i>. There's <i>ORION</i> the son of
  <i>Neptune</i>, or as some say, the grandson of <i>Minos</i>, with his
  <i>DOGS</i>, and <i>HARE</i>, and <i>RIVER</i>, and <i>SCORPION</i>.
  There's the story of <i>Perseus</i> in the Constellations of
  <i>PERSEUS</i>, <i>ANDROMEDA</i>, <i>CEPHEUS</i>, <i>CASSIOPEA</i> and
  <i>CETUS</i>: That of <i>Callisto</i>, and her son <i>Arcas</i>, in
  <i>URSA MAJOR</i> and <i>ARCTOPHYLAX</i>: That of <i>Icareus</i> and his
  daughter <i>Erigone</i> in <i>BOOTES</i>, <i>PLAUSTRUM</i> and
  <i>VIRGO</i>. <i>URSA MINOR</i> relates to one of the Nurses of
  <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>AURIGA</i> to <i>Erechthonius</i>, <i>OPHIUCHUS</i> to
  <i>Phorbas</i>, <i>SAGITTARIUS</i> to <i>Crolus</i> the son of the Nurse
  of the Muses, <i>CAPRICORN</i> to <i>Pan</i>, and <i>AQUARIUS</i> to
  <i>Ganimede</i>. There's <i>Ariadne</i>'s <i>CROWN</i>,
  <i>Bellerophon</i>'s <i>HORSE</i>, <i>Neptune</i>'s <i>DOLPHIN</i>,
  <i>Ganimede</i>'s <i>EAGLE</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>'s <i>GOAT</i> with her
  <i>KIDS</i>, <i>Bacchus</i>'s <i>ASSES</i>, and the <i>FISHES</i> of
  <i>Venus</i> and <i>Cupid</i>, and their Parent the <i>SOUTH FISH</i>.
  These with <i>DELTOTON</i>, are the old Constellations mentioned by
  <i>Aratus</i>: and they all relate to the <i>Argonauts</i> and their
  Contemporaries, and to Persons one or two Generations older: and nothing
  later than that Expedition was delineated there Originally.
  <i>ANTINOUS</i> and <i>COMA BERENICES</i> are novel. The Sphere seems
  therefore to have been formed by <i>Chiron</i> and <i>Musæus</i>, for the
  use of the <i>Argonauts</i>: for the Ship <i>Argo</i> was the first long
  ship built by the <i>Greeks</i>. Hitherto they had used round vessels of
  burden, and kept within sight of the shore; and now, upon an Embassy to
  several Princes upon the coasts of the <i>Euxine</i> and
  <i>Mediterranean</i> Seas, <a name="NtA_74"
  href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> by the dictates of the Oracle, and
  consent of the Princes of <i>Greece</i>, the Flower of <i>Greece</i> were
  to sail with Expedition through the deep, in a long Ship with Sails, and
  guide their Ship by the Stars. The People of the Island <i>Corcyra</i> <a
  name="NtA_75" href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> attributed the invention
  of the Sphere to <i>Nausicaa</i>, the daughter of <i>Alcinous</i>, King
  of the <i>Pheaces</i> in that Island: and it's most probable that she had
  it from the <i>Argonauts</i>, who <a name="NtA_76"
  href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> in their return home sailed to that
  Island, and made some stay there with her father. So then in the time of
  the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition, the Cardinal points of the Equinoxes
  and Solstices were in the middles of the Constellations of <i>Aries</i>,
  <i>Cancer</i>, <i>Chelæ</i>, and <i>Capricorn</i>.</p>

  00", with North Latitude 7°. 8'. 58". And the Star called <i>ultima caudæ
  Arietis</i> was in <img src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 19°. 3'.
  42", with North Latitude 2°. 34'. 5". And the <i>Colurus
  Æquinoctiorum</i> passing through the point in the middle between those
  two Stars did then cut the Ecliptic in <img src="images/taurus.png"
  alt="Taurus" />. 6°. 44': and by this reckoning the Equinox in the end of
  the year 1689 was gone back 36°. 44'. since the <i>Argonautic</i>
  Expedition: Supposing that the said <i>Colure</i> passed through the
  middle of the Constellation of <i>Aries</i>, according to the delineation
  of the Ancients. The Equinox goes back fifty seconds in one year, and one
  degree in seventy and two years, and by consequence 36°. 44'. in 2645
  years, which counted back from the end of the year of our Lord 1689, or
  beginning of the year 1690, will place the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition
  about 25 years after the Death of <i>Solomon</i>: but it is not necessary
  that the middle of the Constellation of <i>Aries</i> should be exactly in
  the middle between the two Stars called <i>prima Arietis</i> and
  <i>ultima Caudæ</i>: and it may be better to fix the Cardinal points by
  the Stars, through which the <i>Colures</i> passed in the primitive
  Sphere, according to the description of <i>Eudoxus</i> above recited. By
  the <i>Colure</i> of the Equinoxes, I mean a great Circle passing through
  the Poles of the Equator, and cutting the Ecliptic in the Equinoxes in an
  Angle of 66½ degrees, the complement of the Sun's greatest Declination;
  and by the <i>Colure</i> of the Solstices I mean a great Circle passing
  through the same Poles, and cutting the Ecliptic at right Angles in the
  Solstices: and by the Primitive Sphere, that which was in use before the
  motions of the Equinoxes and Solstices were known: now the <i>Colures</i>
  passed through the following Stars according to <i>Eudoxus</i>.</p>

  <p>In the back of <i>Aries</i> is a Star of the sixth magnitude, marked
  &#x3BD; by <i>Bayer</i>: in the end of the year 1689, and beginning of
  the year 1690, its Longitude was <img src="images/taurus.png"
  alt="Taurus" />. 9°. 38'. 45", and North Latitude 6°. 7'. 56": and the
  <i>Colurus Æquinoctiorum</i> drawn though it, according to
  <i>Eudoxus</i>, cuts the Ecliptic in <img src="images/taurus.png"
  alt="Taurus" />. 6°. 58'. 57". In the head of <i>Cetus</i> are two Stars
  of the fourth Magnitude, called &#x3BD; and &#x3BE; by <i>Bayer</i>: in
  the end of the year 1689 their Longitudes were <img
  src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 4°. 3'. 9". and <img
  src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 3°. 7'. 37", and their South
  Latitudes 9°. 12'. 26". and 5°. 53'. 7"; and the <i>Colurus
  Æquinoctiorum</i> passing in the mid way between them, cuts the Ecliptic
  in <img src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 6°. 58'. 51". In the
  extreme flexure of <i>Eridanus</i>, rightly delineated, is a Star of the
  fourth Magnitude, of late referred to the breast of <i>Cetus</i>, and
  called &#x3C1; by <i>Bayer</i>; it is the only Star in <i>Eridanus</i>
  through which this <i>Colure</i> can pass; its Longitude, in the end of
  the year 1689, was <img src="images/aries.png" alt="Aries" />. 25°. 22'.
  10". and South Latitude 25°. 15'. 50". and the <i>Colurus
  Æquinoctiorum</i> passing through it, cuts the Ecliptic in <img
  src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 7°. 12'. 40". In the head of
  <i>Perseus</i>, rightly delineated, is a Star of the fourth Magnitude,
  called &#x3C4; by <i>Bayer</i>; the Longitude of this Star, in the end of
  the year 1689, was <img src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 23°.
  25'. 30", and North Latitude 34°. 20'. 12": and the <i>Colurus
  Æquinoctiorum</i> passing through it, cuts the Ecliptic in <img
  src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 6°. 18'. 57". In the right hand
  of <i>Perseus</i>, rightly delineated, is a Star of the fourth Magnitude,
  called &#x3B7; by <i>Bayer</i>; its Longitude in the end of the year
  1689, was <img src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 24°. 25'. 27",
  and North Latitude 37°. 26'. 50": and the <i>Colurus Æquinoctiorum</i>
  passing through it cuts the Ecliptic in <img src="images/taurus.png"
  alt="Taurus" />. 4°. 56'. 40": and the fifth part of the summ of the
  places in which these five <i>Colures</i> cut the Ecliptic, is <img
  src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 6°. 29'. 15": and therefore the
  Great Circle which in the Primitive Sphere according to <i>Eudoxus</i>,
  and by consequence in the time of the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition, was
  the <i>Colurus Æquinoctiorum</i> passing through the Stars above
  described; did in the end of the year 1689, cut the Ecliptic in <img
  src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />. 6°. 29'. 15": as nearly as we
  have been able to determin by the Observations of the Ancients, which
  were but coarse.</p>

  <p>In the middle of <i>Cancer</i> is the <i>South Asellus</i>, a Star of
  the fourth Magnitude, called by <i>Bayer</i> &#x3B4;; its Longitude in
  the end of the year 1689, was <img src="images/leo.png" alt="Leo" />. 4°.
  23'. 40". In the neck of <i>Hydrus</i>, rightly delineated, is a Star of
  the fourth Magnitude, called &#x3B4; by <i>Bayer</i>; its Longitude in
  the end of the year 1689, was <img src="images/leo.png" alt="Leo" />. 5°.
  59'. 3". Between the poop and mast of the Ship <i>Argo</i> is a Star of
  the third Magnitude, called &#x3B9; by <i>Bayer</i>; its Longitude in the
  end of that year, was <img src="images/leo.png" alt="Leo" />. 7°. 5'.
  31". In <i>Sagitta</i> is a Star of the sixth Magnitude, called &#x3B8;
  by <i>Bayer</i>; its Longitude in the end of the same year 1689, was <img
  src="images/aquarius.png" alt="Aquarius" />. 6°. 29'. 53". In the middle
  of <i>Capricorn</i> is a Star of the fifth Magnitude, called &#x3B7; by
  <i>Bayer</i>; its Longitude in the end of the same year was <img
  src="images/aquarius.png" alt="Aquarius" />. 8°. 25'. 55": and the fifth
  part of the summ of the three first Longitudes, and of the complements of
  the two last to 180 Degrees; is <img src="images/leo.png" alt="Leo" />.
  6°. 28'. 46". This is the new Longitude of the old <i>Colurus
  Solstitiorum</i> passing through these Stars. The same <i>Colurus</i>
  passes also in the middle between the Stars &#x3B7; and &#x3BA;, of the
  fourth and fifth Magnitudes, in the neck of the <i>Swan</i>; being
  distant from each about a Degree: it passeth also by the Star &#x3BA;, of
  the fourth Magnitude, in the right wing of the <i>Swan</i>; and by the
  Star &#x3BF;, of the fifth Magnitude, in the left hand of <i>Cepheus</i>,
  rightly delineated; and by the Stars in the tail of the
  <i>South-Fish</i>; and is at right angles with the <i>Colurus
  Æquinoctiorum</i> found above: and so it hath all the characters, of the
  <i>Colurus Solstitiorum</i> rightly drawn.</p>

  <p>The two <i>Colures</i> therefore, which in the time of the
  <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition cut the Ecliptic in the Cardinal Points, did
  in the end of the year 1689 cut it in <img src="images/taurus.png"
  alt="Taurus" />. 6°. 29'; <img src="images/leo.png" alt="Leo" />. 6°.
  29'; <img src="images/scorpio.png" alt="Scorpio" />. 6°. 29'; and <img
  src="images/aquarius.png" alt="Aquarius" />. 6°. 29'; that is, at the
  distance of 1 Sign, 6 Degrees and 29 Minutes from the Cardinal Points of
  <i>Chiron</i>; as nearly as we have been able to determin from the coarse
  observations of the Ancients: and therefore the Cardinal Points, in the
  time between that Expedition and the end of the year 1689, have gone back
  from those <i>Colures</i> one Sign, 6 Degrees and 29 Minutes; which,
  after the rate of 72 years to a Degree, answers to 2627 years. Count
  those years backwards from the end of the year 1689, or beginning of the
  year 1690, and the reckoning will place the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition,
  about 43 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

  <p>By the same method the place of any Star in the Primitive Sphere may
  readily be found, counting backwards one Sign, 6°. 29'. from the
  Longitude which it had in the end of the year of our Lord 1689. So the
  Longitude of the first Star of <i>Aries</i> in the end of the year 1689
  was <img src="images/aries.png" alt="Aries" />. 28°. 51'. as above: count
  backward 1 Sign, 6°. 29'. and its Longitude, counted from the Equinox in
  the middle of the Constellation of <i>Aries</i>, in the time of the
  <i>Argonautic</i> expedition, will be <img src="images/pisces.png"
  alt="Pisces" />. 22°. 22': and by the same way of arguing, the Longitude
  of the <i>Lucida Pleiadum</i> in the time of the <i>Argonautic</i>
  Expedition will be <img src="images/aries.png" alt="Aries" />. 19°. 26'.
  8": and the Longitude of <i>Arcturus</i> <img src="images/virgo.png"
  alt="Virgo" />. 13°. 24'. 52": and so of any other Stars.</p>

  <p>After the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition we hear no more of Astronomy
  'till the days of <i>Thales</i>: He <a name="NtA_77"
  href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> revived Astronomy, and wrote a book of
  the Tropics and Equinoxes, and predicted Eclipses; and <i>Pliny</i> <a
  name="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> tells us, that he
  determined the <i>Occasus Matutinus</i> of the <i>Pleiades</i> to be upon
  the 25th day after the Autumnal Equinox: and thence <a name="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> <i>Petavius</i> computes the Longitude
  of the <i>Pleiades</i> in <img src="images/aries.png" alt="Aries" />.
  23°. 53': and by consequence the <i>Lucida Pleiadum</i> had, since the
  <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition, moved from the Equinox 4°. 26'. 52": and
  this motion, after the rate of 72 years to a Degree, answers to 320
  years: count these years back from the time in which <i>Thales</i> was a
  young man fit to apply himself to Astronomical Studies, that is from
  about the 41st Olympiad, and the reckoning will place the
  <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition about 44 years after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>, as above: and in the days of <i>Thales</i>, the Solstices
  and Equinoxes, by this reckoning, will have been in the middle of the
  eleventh Degrees of the Signs. But <i>Thales</i>, in publishing his book
  about the Tropics and Equinoxes, might lean a little to the opinion of
  former Astronomers, so as to place them in the twelfth Degrees of the
  Signs.</p>

  <p><i>Meton</i> and <i>Euctemon</i>, <a name="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> in order to publish the Lunar Cycle of
  nineteen years, observed the Summer Solstice in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 316, the year before the <i>Peloponnesian</i> war
  began; and <i>Columella</i> <a name="NtA_81"
  href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> tells us that they placed it in the
  eighth Degree of <i>Cancer</i>, which is at least seven Degrees
  backwarder than at first. Now the Equinox, after the rate of a Degree in
  Seventy and two years, goes backwards seven Degrees in 504 years: count
  backwards those years from the 316th year of <i>Nabonassar</i>, and the
  <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition will fall upon the 44th year after the death
  of <i>Solomon</i>, or thereabout, as above. And thus you see the truth of
  what we cited above out of <i>Achilles Tatius</i>; viz. that some
  anciently placed the Solstice in the eighth Degree of <i>Cancer</i>,
  others about the twelfth Degree, and others about the fifteenth Degree
  thereof.</p>

  <p><i>Hipparchus</i> the great Astronomer, comparing his own Observations
  with those of former Astronomers, concluded first of any man, that the
  Equinoxes had a motion backwards in respect of the fixt Stars: and his
  opinion was, that they went backwards one Degree in about an hundred
  years. He made his observations of the Equinoxes between the years of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 586 and 618: the middle year is 602, which is 286 years
  after the aforesaid observation of <i>Meton</i> and <i>Euctemon</i>; and
  in these years the Equinox must have gone backwards four degrees, and so
  have been in the fourth Degree of <i>Aries</i> in the days of
  <i>Hipparchus</i>, and by consequence have then gone back eleven Degrees
  since the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition; that is, in 1090 years, according
  to the Chronology of the ancient <i>Greeks</i> then in use: and this is
  after the rate of about 99 years, or in the next round number an hundred
  years to a Degree, as was then stated by <i>Hipparchus</i>. But it really
  went back a Degree in seventy and two years, and eleven Degrees in 792
  years: count these 792 years backward from the year of <i>Nabonassar,</i>
  602, the year from which we counted the 286 years, and the reckoning will
  place the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition about 43 years after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>. The <i>Greeks</i> have therefore made the
  <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition about three hundred years ancienter than the
  truth, and thereby given occasion to the opinion of the great
  <i>Hipparchus</i>, that the Equinox went backward after the rate of only
  a Degree in an hundred years.</p>

  <p><i>Hesiod</i> tells us that sixty days after the winter Solstice the
  Star <i>Arcturus</i> rose just at Sunset: and thence it follows that
  <i>Hesiod</i> flourished about an hundred years after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>, or in the Generation or Age next after the <i>Trojan</i>
  war, as <i>Hesiod</i> himself declares.</p>

  <p>From all these circumstances, grounded upon the coarse observations of
  the ancient Astronomers, we may reckon it certain that the
  <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition was not earlier than the Reign of
  <i>Solomon</i>: and if these Astronomical arguments be added to the
  former arguments taken from the mean length of the Reigns of Kings,
  according to the course of nature; from them all we may safely conclude
  that the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition was after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>, and most probably that it was about 43 years after
  it.</p>

  <p>The <i>Trojan</i> War was one Generation later than that Expedition,
  as was said above, several Captains of the <i>Greeks</i> in that war
  being sons of the <i>Argonauts</i>: and the ancient <i>Greeks</i>
  reckoned <i>Memnon</i> or <i>Amenophis</i>, King of <i>Egypt</i>, to have
  Reigned in the times of that war, feigning him to be the son of
  <i>Tithonus</i> the elder brother of <i>Priam</i>, and in the end of that
  war to have come from <i>Susa</i> to the assistance of <i>Priam</i>.
  <i>Amenophis</i> was therefore of the same age with the elder children of
  <i>Priam</i>, and was with his army at <i>Susa</i> in the last year of
  that war: and after he had there finished the <i>Memnonia</i>, he might
  return into <i>Egypt</i>, and adorn it with Buildings, and Obelisks, and
  Statues, and die there about 90 or 95 years after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>; when he had determined and settled the beginning of the
  new <i>Egyptian</i> year of 365 days upon the Vernal Equinox, so as to
  deserve the Monument above-mentioned in memory thereof.</p>

  <p><i>Rehoboam</i> was born in the last year of King <i>David</i>, being
  41 years old at the Death of <i>Solomon</i>, 1 <i>Kings</i> xiv. 21. and
  therefore his father <i>Solomon</i> was probably born in the 18th year of
  King <i>David's</i> Reign, or before: and two or three years before his
  Birth, <i>David</i> besieged <i>Rabbah</i> the Metropolis of the
  <i>Ammonites</i>, and committed adultery with <i>Bathsheba</i>: and the
  year before this siege began, <i>David</i> vanquished the
  <i>Ammonites</i>, and their Confederates the <i>Syrians</i> of
  <i>Zobah</i>, and <i>Rehob</i>, and <i>Ishtob</i>, and <i>Maacah</i>, and
  <i>Damascus</i>, and extended his Dominion over all these Nations as far
  as to the entring in of <i>Hamath</i> and the River <i>Euphrates</i>: and
  before this war began he smote <i>Moab</i>, and <i>Ammon</i>, and
  <i>Edom</i>, and made the <i>Edomites</i> fly, some of them into
  <i>Egypt</i> with their King <i>Hadad</i>, then a little child; and
  others to the <i>Philistims</i>, where they fortified <i>Azoth</i>
  against <i>Israel</i>; and others, I think, to the <i>Persian Gulph</i>,
  and other places whither they could escape: and before this he had
  several Battles with the <i>Philistims</i>: and all this was after the
  eighth year of his Reign, in which he came from <i>Hebron</i> to
  <i>Jerusalem</i>. We cannot err therefore above two or three years, if we
  place this Victory over <i>Edom</i> in the eleventh or twelfth year of
  his Reign; and that over <i>Ammon</i> and the <i>Syrians</i> in the
  fourteenth. After the flight of <i>Edom</i>, the King of <i>Edom</i> grew
  up, and married <i>Tahaphenes</i> or <i>Daphnis</i>, the sister of
  <i>Pharaoh</i>'s Queen, and before the Death of <i>David</i> had by her a
  son called <i>Genubah</i>, and this son was brought up among the children
  of <i>Pharaoh</i>: and among these children was the chief or <i>first
  born of her mother's children</i>, whom <i>Solomon</i> married in the
  beginning of his Reign; and her <i>little sister who</i> at that time
  <i>had no breasts</i>, and her <i>brother who</i> then <i>sucked the
  breasts of his mother</i>, <i>Cant.</i> vi. 9. and viii. 1, 8: and of
  about the same Age with these children was <i>Sesac</i> or
  <i>Sesostris</i>; for he became King of <i>Egypt</i> in the Reign of
  <i>Solomon</i>, 1 <i>Kings</i> xi. 40; and before he began to Reign he
  warred under his father, and whilst he was very young, conquered
  <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Troglodytica</i> and <i>Libya</i>, and then invaded
  <i>Ethiopia</i>; and succeeding his father Reigned 'till the fifth year
  of <i>Asa</i>: and therefore he was of about the same age with the
  children of <i>Pharaoh</i> above-mentioned; and might be one of them, and
  be born near the end of <i>David</i>'s Reign, and be about 46 years old
  when he came out of <i>Egypt</i> with a great Army to invade the East:
  and by reason of his great Conquests, he was celebrated in several
  Nations by several Names. The <i>Chaldæans</i> called him <i>Belus</i>,
  which in their Language signified <i>the Lord</i>: the <i>Arabians</i>
  called him <i>Bacchus</i>, which in their Language signified <i>the
  great</i>: the <i>Phrygians</i> and <i>Thracians</i> called him
  <i>Ma-fors</i>, <i>Mavors</i>, <i>Mars</i>, which signified <i>the
  valiant</i>: and thence the <i>Amazons</i>, whom he carried from
  <i>Thrace</i> and left at <i>Thermodon</i>, called themselves the
  daughters of <i>Mars</i>. The <i>Egyptians</i> before his Reign called
  him their <i>Hero</i> or <i>Hercules</i>; and after his death, by reason
  of his great works done to the River <i>Nile</i>, dedicated that River to
  him, and Deified him by its names <i>Sihor</i>, <i>Nilus</i> and
  <i>Ægyptus</i>; and the <i>Greeks</i> hearing them lament <i>0 Sihor, Bou
  Sihor</i>, called him <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Busiris</i>. <i>Arrian</i> <a
  name="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> tells us that the
  <i>Arabians</i> worshipped, only two Gods, <i>C&#339;lus</i> and
  <i>Dionysus</i>; and that they worshipped <i>Dionysus</i> for the glory
  of leading his Army into <i>India</i>. The <i>Dionysus</i> of the
  <i>Arabians</i> was <i>Bacchus</i>, and all agree that <i>Bacchus</i> was
  the same King of <i>Egypt</i> with <i>Osiris</i>: and the
  <i>C&#339;lus</i>, or <i>Uranus</i>, or <i>Jupiter Uranius</i> of the
  <i>Arabians</i>, I take to be the same King of <i>Egypt</i> with His
  father <i>Ammon</i>, according to the Poet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Quamvis Æthiopum populis, Arabumque beatis</i></p>
      <p><i>Gentibus, atque Indis unus sit Jupiter Ammon.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I place the end of the Reign of <i>Sesac</i> upon the fifth year of
  <i>Asa</i>, because in that year <i>Asa</i> became free from the Dominion
  of <i>Egypt</i>, so as to be able to fortify <i>Judæa</i>, and raise that
  great Army with which he met <i>Zerah</i>, and routed him. <i>Osiris</i>
  was therefore slain in the fifth year of <i>Asa</i>, by his brother
  <i>Japetus</i>, whom the <i>Egyptians</i> called <i>Typhon</i>,
  <i>Python</i>, and <i>Neptune</i>: and then the <i>Libyans</i>, under
  <i>Japetus</i> and his son <i>Atlas</i>, invaded <i>Egypt</i>, and raised
  that famous war between the Gods and Giants, from whence the <i>Nile</i>
  had the name of <i>Eridanus</i>: but <i>Orus</i> the son of
  <i>Osiris</i>, by the assistance of the <i>Ethiopians</i>, prevailed, and
  Reigned 'till the 15th year of <i>Asa</i>: and then the <i>Ethiopians</i>
  under <i>Zerah</i> invaded <i>Egypt</i>, drowned <i>Orus</i> in
  <i>Eridanus</i>, and were routed by <i>Asa</i>, so that <i>Zerah</i>
  could not recover himself. <i>Zerah</i> was succeeded by
  <i>Amenophis</i>, a youth of the Royal Family of the <i>Ethiopians</i>,
  and I think the son of <i>Zerah</i>: but the People of the lower
  <i>Egypt</i> revolted from him, and set up <i>Osarsiphus</i> over them,
  and called to their assistance a great body of men from
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, I think a part of the Army of <i>Asa</i>; and
  thereupon <i>Amenophis</i>, with the remains of his father's Army of
  <i>Ethiopians</i>, retired from the lower <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Memphis</i>,
  and there turned the River <i>Nile</i> into a new channel, under a new
  bridge which he built between two Mountains; and at the same time he
  built and fortified that City against <i>Osarsiphus</i>, calling it by
  his own name, <i>Amenoph</i> or <i>Memphis</i>: and then he retired into
  <i>Ethiopia</i>, and stayed there thirteen years; and then came back with
  a great Army, and subdued the lower <i>Egypt</i>, expelling the People
  which had been called in from <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>: and this I take to be
  the second expulsion of the Shepherds. Dr. <i>Castel</i> <a name="NtA_83"
  href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> tells us, that in <i>Coptic</i> this
  City is called <i>Manphtha</i>; whence by contraction came its Names
  <i>Moph</i>, <i>Noph</i>.</p>

  <p>While <i>Amenophis</i> staid in <i>Ethiopia</i>, <i>Egypt</i> was in
  its greatest distraction: and then it was, as I conceive, that the
  <i>Greeks</i> hearing thereof contrived the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition,
  and sent the flower of <i>Greece</i> in the Ship <i>Argo</i> to persuade
  the Nations upon the Sea Coasts of the <i>Euxine</i> and <i>Mediterranean
  Seas</i> to revolt from <i>Egypt</i>, and set up for themselves, as the
  <i>Libyans</i>, <i>Ethiopians</i> and <i>Jews</i> had done before. And
  this is a further argument for placing that Expedition about 43 years
  after the Death of <i>Solomon</i>; this Period being in the middle of the
  distraction of <i>Egypt</i>. <i>Amenophis</i> might return from
  <i>Ethiopia</i>, and conquer the lower <i>Egypt</i> about eight years
  after that Expedition, and having settled his Government over it, he
  might, for putting a stop to the revolting of the eastern Nations, lead
  his Army into <i>Persia</i>, and leave <i>Proteus</i> at <i>Memphis</i>
  to govern <i>Egypt</i> in his absence, and stay some time at <i>Susa</i>,
  and build the <i>Memnonia</i>, fortifying that City, as the Metropolis of
  his Dominion in those parts.</p>

  <p><i>Androgeus</i> the son of <i>Minos</i>, upon his overcoming in the
  <i>Athenæa</i>, or quadrennial Games at <i>Athens</i> in his youth, was
  perfidiously slain out of envy: and <i>Minos</i> thereupon made war upon
  the <i>Athenians</i>, and compelled them to send every eighth year to
  <i>Crete</i> seven beardless Youths, and as many young Virgins, to be
  given as a reward to him that should get the Victory in the like Games
  instituted in <i>Crete</i> in honour of <i>Androgeus</i>. These Games
  seem to have been celebrated in the beginning of the <i>Octaeteris</i>,
  and the <i>Athenæa</i> in the beginning of the <i>Tetraeteris</i>, then
  brought into <i>Crete</i> and <i>Greece</i> by the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>
  and upon the third payment of the tribute of children, that is, about
  seventeen years after the said war was at an end, and about nineteen or
  twenty years after the death of <i>Androgeus</i>, <i>Theseus</i> became
  Victor, and returned from <i>Crete</i> with <i>Ariadne</i> the daughter
  of <i>Minos</i>; and coming to the Island <i>Naxus</i> or <i>Dia</i>, <a
  name="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> <i>Ariadne</i> was there
  relinquished by him, and taken up by <i>Glaucus</i>, an <i>Egyptian</i>
  Commander at Sea, and became the mistress of the great <i>Bacchus</i>,
  who at that time returned from <i>India</i> in Triumph; and <a
  name="NtA_85" href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> by him she had two sons,
  <i>Phlyas</i> and <i>Eumedon</i>, who were <i>Argonauts</i>. This
  <i>Bacchus</i> was caught in bed in <i>Phrygia</i> with <i>Venus</i> the
  mother of <i>Æneas</i>, according <a name="NtA_86"
  href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> to <i>Homer</i>; just before he came
  over the <i>Hellespont</i>, and invaded <i>Thrace</i>; and he married
  <i>Ariadne</i> the daughter of <i>Minos</i>, according to <i>Hesiod</i>
  <a name="NtA_87" href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>: and therefore by the
  Testimony of both <i>Homer</i> and <i>Hesiod</i>, who wrote before the
  <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Egyptians</i> corrupted their Antiquities, this
  <i>Bacchus</i> was one Generation older than the <i>Argonauts</i>; and so
  being King of <i>Egypt</i> at the same time with <i>Sesostris</i>, they
  must be one and the same King: for they agree also in their actions;
  <i>Bacchus</i> invaded <i>India</i> and <i>Greece</i>, and after he was
  routed by the Army of <i>Perseus</i>, and the war was composed, the
  <i>Greeks</i> did him great honours, and built a Temple to him at
  <i>Argos</i>, and called it the Temple of the <i>Cresian Bacchus</i>,
  because <i>Ariadne</i> was buried in it, as <i>Pausanias</i> <a
  name="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> relates. <i>Ariadne</i>
  therefore died in the end of the war, just before the return of
  <i>Sesostris</i> into <i>Egypt</i>, that is, in the 14th year of
  <i>Rehoboam</i>: She was taken from <i>Naxus</i> upon the return of
  <i>Bacchus</i> from <i>India</i>, and then became the Mistress of
  <i>Bacchus</i>, and accompanied him in his Triumphs; and therefore the
  expedition of <i>Theseus</i> to <i>Crete</i>, and the death of his father
  <i>Ægeus</i>, was about nine or ten years after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>. <i>Theseus</i> was then a beardless young man, suppose
  about 19 or 20 years old, and <i>Androgeus</i> was slain about twenty
  years before, being then about 20 or 22 years old; and his father
  <i>Minos</i> might be about 25 years older, and so be born about the
  middle of <i>David</i>'s Reign, and be about 70 years old when he pursued
  <i>Dædalus</i> into <i>Sicily</i>: and <i>Europa</i> and her brother
  <i>Cadmus</i> might come into <i>Europe</i>, two or three years before
  the birth of <i>Minos</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Justin</i>, in his 18th book, tells us: <i>A rege Ascaloniorum
  expugnati Sidonii navibus appulsi Tyron urbem ante annum * * Trojanæ
  cladis condiderunt</i> And <i>Strabo</i>, <a name="NtA_89"
  href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> that <i>Aradus was built by the men who
  fled from </i>Zidon. Hence <a name="NtA_90"
  href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> <i>Isaiah</i> calls <i>Tyre</i> <i>the
  daughter of </i>Zidon<i>, the inhabitants of the Isle whom the Merchants
  of </i>Zidon<i> have replenished</i>: and <a name="NtA_91"
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> <i>Solomon</i> in the beginning of his
  Reign calls the People of <i>Tyre</i> <i>Zidonians</i>. <i>My
  Servants</i>, saith he, in a Message to <i>Hiram</i> King of <i>Tyre</i>,
  <i>shall be with thy Servants, and unto thee will I give hire for thy
  Servants according to all that thou desirest: for thou knowest that there
  is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like the </i>Zidonians.
  The new Inhabitants of <i>Tyre</i> had not yet lost the name of
  <i>Zidonians</i>, nor had the old Inhabitants, if there were any
  considerable number of them, gained the reputation of the new ones for
  skill in hewing of timber, as they would have done had navigation been
  long in use at <i>Tyre</i>. The Artificers who came from <i>Zidon</i>
  were not dead, and the flight of the <i>Zidonians</i> was in the Reign of
  <i>David</i>, and by consequence in the beginning of the Reign of
  <i>Abibalus</i> the father of <i>Hiram</i>, and the first King of
  <i>Tyre</i> mentioned in History. <i>David</i> in the twelfth year of his
  Reign conquered <i>Edom</i>, as above, and made some of the

  of the Fugitives from the Red Sea built</i> Azoth: that is, a Prince of
  <i>Edom</i>, who fled from <i>David</i>, fortified <i>Azoth</i> for the
  <i>Philistims</i> against him. The <i>Philistims</i> were now grown very
  strong, by the access of the <i>Edomites</i> and Shepherds, and by their
  assistance invaded and took <i>Zidon</i>, that being a town very
  convenient for the Merchants who fled from the <i>Red Sea</i>: and then
  did the <i>Zidonians</i> fly by Sea to <i>Tyre</i> and <i>Aradus</i>, and
  to other havens in <i>Asia Minor</i>, <i>Greece</i>, and <i>Libya</i>,
  with which, by means of their trade, they had been acquainted before; the
  great wars and victories of <i>David</i> their enemy, prompting them to
  fly by Sea: for <a name="NtA_93" href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> they
  went with a great multitude, not to seek <i>Europa</i> as was pretended,
  but to seek new Seats, and therefore fled from their enemies: and when
  some of them fled under <i>Cadmus</i> and his brothers to <i>Cilicia</i>,
  <i>Asia minor</i>, and <i>Greece</i>; others fled under other Commanders
  to seek new Seats in <i>Libya</i>, and there built many walled towns, as
  <i>Nonnus</i> <a name="NtA_94" href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> affirms:
  and their leader was also there called <i>Cadmus</i>, which word
  signifies an eastern man, and his wife was called <i>Sithonis</i> a
  <i>Zidonian</i>. Many from those Cities went afterwards with the great
  <i>Bacchus</i> in his Armies: and by these things, the taking of
  <i>Zidon</i>, and the flight of the <i>Zidonians</i> under
  <i>Abibalus</i>, <i>Cadmus</i>, <i>Cilix</i>, <i>Thasus</i>,
  <i>Membliarius</i>, <i>Atymnus</i>, and other Captains, to <i>Tyre</i>,
  <i>Aradus</i>, <i>Cilicia</i>, <i>Rhodes</i>, <i>Caria</i>,
  <i>Bithynia</i>, <i>Phrygia</i>, <i>Calliste</i>, <i>Thasus</i>,
  <i>Samothrace</i>, <i>Crete</i>, <i>Greece</i> and <i>Libya</i>, and the
  building of <i>Tyre</i> and <i>Thebes</i>, and beginning of the Reigns of
  <i>Abibalus</i> and <i>Cadmus</i> over those Cities, are fixed upon the
  fifteenth or sixteenth year of <i>David</i>'s Reign, or thereabout. By
  means of these Colonies of <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>, the people of
  <i>Caria</i> learnt sea-affairs, in such small vessels with oars as were
  then in use, and began to frequent the <i>Greek Seas</i>, and people some
  of the Islands therein, before the Reign of <i>Minos</i>: for
  <i>Cadmus</i>, in coming to <i>Greece</i>, arrived first at
  <i>Rhodes</i>, an Island upon the borders of <i>Caria</i>, and left there
  a Colony of <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>, who sacrificed men to <i>Saturn</i>,
  and the <i>Telchines</i> being repulsed by <i>Phoroneus</i>, retired from
  <i>Argos</i> to <i>Rhodes</i> with <i>Phorbas</i>, who purged the Island
  from Serpents; and <i>Triopas</i>, the son of <i>Phorbas</i>, carried a
  Colony from <i>Rhodes</i> to <i>Caria</i>, and there possessed himself of
  a promontory, thence called <i>Triopium</i>: and by this and such like
  Colonies <i>Caria</i> was furnished with Shipping and Seamen, and called
  <a name="NtA_95" href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> <i>Ph&#339;nice</i>.
  <i>Strabo</i> and <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_96"
  href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> tell us, that the <i>Cares</i> were
  called <i>Leleges</i>, and became subject to <i>Minos</i>, and lived
  first in the Islands of the <i>Greek Seas</i>, and went thence into
  <i>Caria</i>, a country possest before by some of the <i>Leleges</i> and
  <i>Pelasgi</i>: whence it's probable that when <i>Lelex</i> and
  <i>Pelasgus</i> came first into <i>Greece</i> to seek new Seats, they
  left part of their Colonies in <i>Caria</i> and the neighbouring
  Islands.</p>

  <p>The <i>Zidonians</i> being still possessed of the trade of the
  <i>Mediterranean</i>, as far westward as <i>Greece</i> and <i>Libya</i>,
  and the trade of the <i>Red Sea</i> being richer; the <i>Tyrians</i>
  traded on the <i>Red Sea</i> in conjunction with <i>Solomon</i> and the
  Kings of <i>Judah</i>, 'till after the <i>Trojan</i> war; and so also did
  the Merchants of <i>Aradus</i>, <i>Arvad</i>, or <i>Arpad</i>: for in the
  <i>Persian Gulph</i> <a name="NtA_97" href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>
  were two Islands called <i>Tyre</i> and <i>Aradus</i>, which had Temples
  like the <i>Ph&#339;nician</i>; and therefore the <i>Tyrians</i> and
  <i>Aradians</i> sailed thither, and beyond, to the Coasts of
  <i>India</i>, while the <i>Zidonians</i> frequented the
  <i>Mediterranean</i>: and hence it is that <i>Homer</i> celebrates
  <i>Zidon</i>, and makes no mention of <i>Tyre</i>. But at length, <a
  name="NtA_98" href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> in the Reign of
  <i>Jehoram</i> King of <i>Judah</i>, <i>Edom</i> revolted from the
  Dominion of <i>Judah</i>, and made themselves a King; and the trade of
  <i>Judah</i> and <i>Tyre</i> upon the <i>Red Sea</i> being thereby
  interrupted, the <i>Tyrians</i> built ships for merchandise upon the
  <i>Mediterranean</i>, and began there to make long Voyages to places not
  yet frequented by the <i>Zidonians</i>; some of them going to the coasts
  of <i>Afric</i> beyond the <i>Syrtes</i>, and building <i>Adrymetum</i>,
  <i>Carthage</i>, <i>Leptis</i>, <i>Utica</i>, and <i>Capsa</i>; and
  others going to the Coasts of <i>Spain</i>, and building <i>Carteia</i>,
  <i>Gades</i> and <i>Tartessus</i>; and others going further to the
  <i>Fortunate Islands</i>, and to <i>Britain</i> and <i>Thule</i>.
  <i>Jehoram</i> Reigned eight years, and the two last years was sick in
  his bowels, and before that sickness <i>Edom</i> revolted, because of
  <i>Jehoram</i>'s wicked Reign: if we place that revolt about the middle
  of the first six years, it will fall upon the fifth year of
  <i>Pygmalion</i> King of <i>Tyre</i>, and so was about twelve or fifteen
  years after the taking of <i>Troy</i>: and then, by reason of this
  revolt, the <i>Tyrians</i> retired from the <i>Red Sea</i>, and began
  long Voyages upon the <i>Mediterranean</i>; for in the seventh year of
  <i>Pygmalion</i>, his Sister <i>Dido</i> sailed to the Coast of
  <i>Afric</i> beyond the <i>Syrtes</i>, and there built <i>Carthage</i>.
  This retiring of the <i>Tyrians</i> from the <i>Red Sea</i> to make long
  Voyages on the <i>Mediterranean</i>, together with the flight of the
  <i>Edomites</i> from <i>David</i> to the <i>Philistims</i>, gave occasion
  to the tradition both of the ancient <i>Persians</i>, and of the
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> themselves, that the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> came
  originally from the <i>Red Sea</i> to the coasts of the
  <i>Mediterranean</i>, and presently undertook long Voyages, as
  <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_99" href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>
  relates: for <i>Herodotus</i>, in the beginning of his first book,
  relates that the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> coming from the <i>Red Sea</i> to
  the <i>Mediterranean</i>, and beginning to make long Voyages with
  <i>Egyptian</i> and <i>Assyrian</i> wares, among other places came to
  <i>Argos</i>, and having sold their wares, seized and carried away into
  <i>Egypt</i> some of the <i>Grecian</i> women who came to buy them; and
  amongst those women was <i>Io</i> the daughter of <i>Inachus</i>. The
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> therefore came from the <i>Red Sea</i>, in the
  days of <i>Io</i> and her brother <i>Phoroneus</i> King of <i>Argos</i>,
  and by consequence at that time when <i>David</i> conquered the
  <i>Edomites</i>, and made them fly every way from the <i>Red Sea</i>;
  some into <i>Egypt</i> with their young King, and others to the
  <i>Philistims</i> their next neighbours and the enemies of <i>David</i>.
  And this flight gave occasion to the <i>Philistims</i> to call many
  places <i>Erythra</i>, in memory of their being <i>Erythreans</i> or
  <i>Edomites</i>, and of their coming from the <i>Erythrean</i> Sea; for
  <i>Erythra</i> was the name of a City in <i>Ionia</i>, of another in
  <i>Libya</i>, of another in <i>Locris</i>, of another in
  <i>B&#339;otia</i>, of another in <i>Cyprus</i>, of another in
  <i>Ætolia</i>, of another in <i>Asia</i> near <i>Chius</i>; and
  <i>Erythia Acra</i> was a promontory in <i>Libya</i>, and
  <i>Erythræum</i> a promontory in <i>Crete</i>, and <i>Erythros</i> a
  place near <i>Tybur</i>, and <i>Erythini</i> a City or Country in
  <i>Paphlagonia</i>: and the name <i>Erythea</i> or <i>Erythræ</i> was
  given to the Island <i>Gades</i>, peopled by <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>. So
  <i>Solinus</i>, <a name="NtA_100" href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>
  <i>In capite Bæticæ insula a continenti septingentis passibus memoratur
  quam Tyrii a rubro mari profecti Erytheam, P&#339;ni sua lingua Gadir, id
  est sepem nominarunt.</i> And <i>Pliny</i>, <a name="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> concerning a little Island near it;
  <i>Erythia dicta est quoniam Tyrii Aborigines eorum, orti ab Erythræo
  mari ferebantur.</i> Among the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> who came with
  <i>Cadmus</i> into <i>Greece</i>, there were <a name="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> <i>Arabians</i>, and <a
  name="NtA_103" href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> <i>Erythreans</i> or
  Inhabitants of the <i>Red Sea</i>, that is <i>Edomites</i>; and in
  <i>Thrace</i> there settled a People who were circumcised and called
  <i>Odomantes</i>, that is, as some think, <i>Edomites</i>. <i>Edom</i>,
  <i>Erythra</i> and <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> are names of the same
  signification, the words denoting a red colour: which makes it probable
  that the <i>Erythreans</i> who fled from <i>David</i>, settled in great
  numbers in <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, that is, in all the Sea-coasts of
  <i>Syria</i> from <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Zidon</i>; and by calling themselves
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> in the language of <i>Syria</i>, instead of
  <i>Erythreans</i>, gave the name of <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> to all that
  Sea-coast, and to that only. So <i>Strabo</i>: <a name="NtA_104"

  <i>Mons Calpe ad dextram est e nostro mari foras navigantibus, &amp; ad
  quadraginta inde stadia urbs Carteia vetusta ac memorabilis, olim statio
  navibus Hispanorum. Hanc ab Hercule quidam conditam aiunt, inter quos est
  Timosthenes, qui eam antiquitus Heracleam fuisse appellatam refert,
  ostendique adhuc magnum murorum circuitum &amp; navalia.</i> This
  <i>Hercules</i>, in memory of his building and Reigning over the City
  <i>Carteia</i>, they called also <i>Melcartus</i>, the King of
  <i>Carteia</i>. <i>Bochart</i> <a name="NtA_109"
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> writes, that <i>Carteia</i> was at
  first called <i>Melcarteia</i>, from its founder <i>Melcartus</i>, and by
  an <i>Aphæresis</i>, <i>Carteia</i>; and that <i>Melcartus</i> signifies
  <i>Melec Kartha</i>, the King of the city, that is, saith he, of the city
  <i>Tyre</i>: but considering that no ancient Author tells us, that
  <i>Carteia</i> was ever called <i>Melcarteia</i>, or that
  <i>Melcartus</i> was King of <i>Tyre</i>; I had rather say that
  <i>Melcartus</i>, or <i>Melecartus</i>, had his name from being the
  Founder and Governor or Prince of the city <i>Carteia</i>. Under
  <i>Melcartus</i> the <i>Tyrians</i> sailed as far as <i>Tartessus</i> or
  <i>Tarshish</i>, a place in the Western part of <i>Spain</i>, between the
  two mouths of the river <i>B&#339;tis</i>, and there they <a
  name="NtA_110" href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> met with much silver,
  which they purchased for trifles: they sailed also as far as
  <i>Britain</i> before the death of <i>Melcartus</i>; for <a
  name="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> <i>Pliny</i> tells us,
  <i>Plumbum ex Cassiteride insula primus apportavit Midacritus</i>: And
  <i>Bochart</i> <a name="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>
  observes that <i>Midacritus</i> is a <i>Greek</i> name corruptly written
  for <i>Melcartus</i>; <i>Britain</i> being unknown to the <i>Greeks</i>
  long after it was discovered by the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>. After the
  death of <i>Melcartus</i>, they <a name="NtA_113"
  href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> built a Temple to him in the Island
  <i>Gades</i>, and adorned it with the sculptures of the labours of
  <i>Hercules</i>, and of his <i>Hydra</i>, and the Horses to whom he threw
  <i>Diomedes</i>, King of the <i>Bistones</i> in <i>Thrace</i>, to be
  devoured. In this Temple was the golden Belt of <i>Teucer</i>, and the
  golden Olive of <i>Pygmalion</i> bearing <i>Smaragdine</i> fruit: and by
  these consecrated gifts of <i>Teucer</i> and <i>Pygmalion</i>, you may
  know that it was built in their days. <i>Pomponius</i> derives it from
  the times of the <i>Trojan</i> war; for <i>Teucer</i>, seven years after
  that war, according to the Marbles, arrived at <i>Cyprus</i>, being
  banished from home by his father <i>Telamon</i>, and there built
  <i>Salamis</i>: and he and his Posterity Reigned there 'till
  <i>Evagoras</i>, the last of them, was conquered by the <i>Persians</i>,
  in the twelfth year of <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i>. Certainly this <i>Tyrian
  Hercules</i> could be no older than the <i>Trojan</i> war, because the
  <i>Tyrians</i> did not begin to navigate the <i>Mediterranean</i> 'till
  after that war: for <i>Homer</i> and <i>Hesiod</i> knew nothing of this
  navigation, and the <i>Tyrian Hercules</i> went to the coasts of
  <i>Spain</i>, and was buried in <i>Gades</i>: so <i>Arnobius</i> <a
  name="NtA_114" href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>; <i>Tyrius Hercules
  sepultus in finibus Hispaniæ</i>: and <i>Mela</i>, speaking of the Temple
  of <i>Hercules</i> in <i>Gades</i>, saith, <i>Cur sanctum sit ossa ejus
  ibi sepulta efficiunt</i>. <i>Carthage</i> <a name="NtA_115"
  href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> paid tenths to this <i>Hercules</i>,
  and sent their payments yearly to <i>Tyre</i>: and thence it's probable
  that this <i>Hercules</i> went to the coast of <i>Afric</i>, as well as
  to that of <i>Spain</i>, and by his discoveries prepared the way to
  <i>Dido</i>: <i>Orosius</i> <a name="NtA_116"
  href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> and others tell us that he built
  <i>Capsa</i> there. <i>Josephus</i> tells of an earlier <i>Hercules</i>,
  to whom <i>Hiram</i> built a Temple at <i>Tyre</i>: and perhaps there
  might be also an earlier <i>Hercules</i> of <i>Tyre</i>, who set on foot
  their trade on the <i>Red Sea</i> in the days of <i>David</i> or
  <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Tatian</i>, in his book against the <i>Greeks</i>, relates, that
  amongst the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> flourished three ancient Historians,
  <i>Theodotus</i>, <i>Hysicrates</i> and <i>Mochus</i>, <i>who all of them
  delivered in their histories, translated into </i>Greek<i> by
  </i>Latus<i>, under which of the Kings happened the rapture of
  </i>Europa<i>; the voyage of </i>Menelaus<i> into </i>Ph&#339;nicia<i>;
  and the league and friendship between </i>Solomon<i> and </i>Hiram<i>,
  when </i>Hiram<i> gave his daughter to </i>Solomon<i>, and furnished him
  with timber for building the Temple: and that the same is affirmed by
  </i>Menander<i> of </i>Pergamus. <i>Josephus</i> <a name="NtA_117"
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> lets us know that the Annals of the
  <i>Tyrians</i>, from the days of <i>Abibalus</i> and <i>Hiram</i>, Kings
  of <i>Tyre</i>, were extant in his days; and that <i>Menander</i> of
  <i>Pergamus</i> translated them into <i>Greek</i>, and that
  <i>Hiram</i>'s friendship to <i>Solomon</i>, and assistance in building
  the Temple, was mentioned in them; and that the Temple was founded in the
  eleventh year of <i>Hiram</i>: and by the testimony of <i>Menander</i>
  and the ancient <i>Ph&#339;nician</i> historians, the rapture of
  <i>Europa</i>, and by consequence the coming of her brother <i>Cadmus</i>
  into <i>Greece</i>, happened within the time of the Reigns of the Kings
  of <i>Tyre</i> delivered in these histories; and therefore not before the
  Reign of <i>Abibalus</i>, the first of them, nor before the Reign of King
  <i>David</i> his contemporary. The voyage of <i>Menelaus</i> might be
  after the destruction of <i>Troy</i>. <i>Solomon</i> therefore Reigned in
  the times between the raptures of <i>Europa</i> and <i>Helena</i>, and
  <i>Europa</i> and her brother <i>Cadmus</i> flourished in the days or
  <i>David</i>. <i>Minos</i>, the son of <i>Europa</i>, flourished in the
  Reign of <i>Solomon</i>, and part of the Reign of <i>Rehoboam</i>: and
  the children of <i>Minos</i>, namely <i>Androgeus</i> his eldest son,
  <i>Deucalion</i> his youngest son and one of the <i>Argonauts</i>,
  <i>Ariadne</i> the mistress of <i>Theseus</i> and <i>Bacchus</i>, and
  <i>Phædra</i> the wife of <i>Theseus</i>; flourished in the latter end of
  <i>Solomon</i>, and in the Reigns of <i>Rehoboam</i>, <i>Abijah</i> and
  <i>Asa</i>: and <i>Idomeneus</i>, the grandson of <i>Minos</i>, was at
  the war of <i>Troy</i>: and <i>Hiram</i> succeeded his father
  <i>Abibalus</i>, in the three and twentieth year of <i>David</i>: and
  <i>Abibalus</i> might found the Kingdom of <i>Tyre</i> about sixteen or
  eighteen years before, when <i>Zidon</i> was taken by the
  <i>Philistims</i>; and the <i>Zidonians</i> fled from thence, under the
  conduct of <i>Cadmus</i> and other commanders, to seek new seats. Thus by
  the Annals of <i>Tyre</i>, and the ancient <i>Ph&#339;nician</i>
  Historians who followed them, <i>Abibalus</i>, <i>Alymnus</i>,
  <i>Cadmus</i>, and <i>Europa</i> fled from <i>Zidon</i> about the
  sixteenth year of <i>David</i>'s Reign: and the <i>Argonautic</i>
  Expedition being later by about three Generations, will be about three
  hundred years later than where the <i>Greeks</i> have placed it.</p>

  <p>After Navigation in long ships with sails, and one order of oars, had
  been propagated from <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and
  <i>Greece</i>, and thereby the <i>Zidonians</i> had extended their trade
  to <i>Greece</i>, and carried it on about an hundred and fifty years; and
  then the <i>Tyrians</i> being driven from the <i>Red Sea</i> by the
  <i>Edomites</i>, had begun a new trade on the <i>Mediterranean</i> with
  <i>Spain</i>, <i>Afric</i>, <i>Britain</i>, and other remote nations;
  they carried it on about an hundred and sixty years; and then the
  <i>Corinthians</i> began to improve Navigation, by building bigger ships
  with three orders of oars, called <i>Triremes</i>. For <a name="NtA_118"
  href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> <i>Thucydides</i> tells us that the
  <i>Corinthians</i> were the first of the <i>Greeks</i> who built such
  ships, and that a ship-carpenter of <i>Corinth</i> went thence to
  <i>Samos</i>, about 300 years before the end of the <i>Peloponnesian</i>
  war, and built also four ships for the <i>Samians</i>; and that 260 years
  before the end of that war, that is, about the 29th Olympiad, there was a
  fight at sea between the <i>Corinthians</i> and the <i>Corcyreans</i>
  which was the oldest sea-fight mentioned in history. <i>Thucydides</i>
  tells us further, that the first colony which the <i>Greeks</i> sent into
  <i>Sicily</i>, came from <i>Chalcis</i> in <i>Eub&#339;a</i>, under the
  conduct of <i>Thucles</i>, and built <i>Naxus</i>; and the next year
  <i>Archias</i> came from <i>Corinth</i> with a colony, and built
  <i>Syracuse</i>; and that <i>Lamis</i> came about the same time into
  <i>Sicily</i>, with a colony from <i>Megara</i> in <i>Achaia</i>, and
  lived first at <i>Trotilum</i>, and then at <i>Leontini</i>, and died at
  <i>Thapsus</i> near <i>Syracuse</i>; and that after his death, this
  colony was invited by <i>Hyblo</i> to <i>Megara</i> in <i>Sicily</i>, and
  lived there 245 years, and was then expelled by <i>Gelo</i> King of
  <i>Sicily</i>. Now <i>Gelo</i> flourished about 78 years before the end
  of the <i>Peloponnesian</i> war: count backwards the 78 and the 245
  years, and about 12 years more for the Reign of <i>Lamis</i> in
  <i>Sicily</i>, and the reckoning will place the building of
  <i>Syracuse</i> about 335 years before the end of the
  <i>Peloponnesian</i> war, or in the tenth Olympiad; and about that time
  <i>Eusebius</i> and others place it: but it might be twenty or thirty
  years later, the antiquities of those days having been raised more or
  less by the <i>Greeks</i>. From the colonies henceforward sent into
  <i>Italy</i> and <i>Sicily</i> came the name of <i>Græcia magna</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Thucydides</i> <a name="NtA_119"
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> tells us further, that the
  <i>Greeks</i> began to come into <i>Sicily</i> almost three hundred years
  after the <i>Siculi</i> had invaded that Island with an army out of
  <i>Italy</i>: suppose it 280 years after, and the building of
  <i>Syracuse</i> 310 years before the end of the <i>Peloponnesian</i> war;
  and that invasion of <i>Sicily</i> by the <i>Siculi</i> will be 590 years
  before the end of that war, that is, in the 27th year of <i>Solomon</i>'s
  Reign, or thereabout. <i>Hellanicus</i> <a name="NtA_120"
  href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> tells us, that it was in the third
  Generation before the <i>Trojan</i> war; and in the 26th year of the
  Priesthood of <i>Alcinoe</i>, Priestess of <i>Juno Argiva</i>: and
  <i>Philistius</i> of <i>Syracuse</i>, that it was 80 years before the
  <i>Trojan</i> war: whence it follows that the <i>Trojan</i> war and
  <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition were later than the days of <i>Solomon</i>
  and <i>Rehoboam</i>, and could not be much earlier than where we have
  placed them.</p>

  <p>The Kingdom of <i>Macedon</i> <a name="NtA_121"
  href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> was founded by <i>Caranus</i> and
  <i>Perdiccas</i>, who being of the Race of <i>Temenus</i> King of
  <i>Argos</i>, fled from <i>Argos</i> in the Reign of <i>Phidon</i> the
  brother of <i>Caranus</i>. <i>Temenus</i> was one of the three brothers
  who led the <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i>, and shared the
  conquest among themselves: he obtained <i>Argos</i>; and after him, and
  his son <i>Cisus</i>, the Kingdom of <i>Argos</i> became divided among
  the posterity of <i>Temenus</i>, until <i>Phidon</i> reunited it,
  expelling his kindred. <i>Phidon</i> grew potent, appointed weights and
  measures in <i>Peloponnesus</i>, and coined silver money; and removing
  the <i>Pisæans</i> and <i>Eleans</i>, presided in the Olympic games; but
  was soon after subdued by the <i>Eleans</i> and <i>Spartans</i>.
  <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_122" href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>
  reckons that <i>Perdiccas</i> was the first King of <i>Macedon</i>; later
  writers, as <i>Livy</i>, <i>Pausanias</i> and <i>Suidas</i>, make
  <i>Caranus</i> the first King: <i>Justin</i> calls <i>Perdiccas</i> the
  Sucessor of <i>Caranus</i>; and <i>Solinus</i> saith that
  <i>Perdiccas</i> succeeded <i>Caranus</i>; and was the first that
  obtained the name of King. It's probable that <i>Caranus</i> and
  <i>Perdiccas</i> were contemporaries, and fled about the same time from
  <i>Phidon</i>, and at first erected small principalities in
  <i>Macedonia</i>, which, after the death of <i>Caranus</i>, became one
  under <i>Perdiccas</i>. <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_123"
  href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> tells us, that after <i>Perdiccas</i>
  Reigned <i>Aræus</i>, or <i>Argæus</i>, <i>Philip</i>, <i>Æropus</i>,
  <i>Alcetas</i>, <i>Amyntas</i>, and <i>Alexander</i>, successively.
  <i>Alexander</i> was contemporary to <i>Xerxes</i> King of <i>Persia</i>,
  and died <i>An.</i> 4. Olymp. 79, and was succeeded by <i>Perdiccas</i>,
  and he by his son <i>Archelaus</i>: and <i>Thucydides</i> <a
  name="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> tells us that there
  were eight Kings of <i>Macedon</i> before this <i>Archelaus</i>: now by
  reckoning above forty years a-piece to these Kings, Chronologers have
  made <i>Phidon</i> and <i>Caranus</i> older than the Olympiads; whereas
  if we should reckon their Reigns at about 18 or 20 years a-piece one with
  another, the first seven Reigns counted backwards from the death of this
  <i>Alexander</i>, will place the dominion of <i>Phidon</i>, and the
  beginning of the Kingdom of <i>Macedon</i> under <i>Perdiccas</i> and
  <i>Caranus</i>, upon the 46th or 47th Olympiad, or thereabout. It could
  scarce be earlier, because <i>Leocides</i> the son of <i>Phidon</i>, and
  <i>Megacles</i> the son of <i>Alcmæon</i>, at one and the same time
  courted <i>Agarista</i>, the daughter of <i>Clisthenes</i> King of
  <i>Sicyon</i>, as <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> tells us; and the <i>Amphictyons</i>,
  by the advice of <i>Solon</i>, made <i>Alcmæon</i>, and
  <i>Clisthenes</i>, and <i>Eurolycus</i> King of <i>Thessaly</i>,
  commanders of their army, in their war against <i>Cirrha</i>; and the
  <i>Cirrheans</i> were conquered <i>An.</i> 2. Olymp. 47. according to the
  Marbles. <i>Phidon</i> therefore and his brother <i>Caranus</i> were
  contemporary to <i>Solon</i>, <i>Alcmæon</i>, <i>Clisthenes</i>, and
  <i>Eurolycus</i>, and flourished about the 48th and 49th Olympiads. They
  were also contemporary in their later days to <i>Cr&#339;sus</i>; for
  <i>Solon</i> conversed with <i>Cr&#339;sus</i>, and <i>Alcmæon</i>
  entertained and conducted the messengers whom <i>Cr&#339;sus</i> sent to
  consult the Oracle at <i>Delphi</i>, <i>An.</i> 1. Olymp. 56. according
  to the Marbles, and was sent for by <i>Cr&#339;sus</i>, and rewarded with
  much riches.</p>

  <p>But the times set down in the Marbles before the <i>Persian</i> Empire
  began, being collected by reckoning the Reigns of Kings equipollent to
  Generations, and three Generations to an hundred years or above; and the
  Reigns of Kings, one with another, being shorter in the proportion of
  about four to seven; the Chronology set down in the Marbles, until the
  Conquest of <i>Media</i> by <i>Cyrus</i>, <i>An.</i> 4, Olymp. 60, will
  approach the truth much nearer, by shortening the times before that
  Conquest in the proportion of four to seven. So the <i>Cirrheans</i> were
  conquered <i>An.</i> 2, Olymp. 47, according to the Marbles, that is 54
  years before the Conquest of <i>Media</i>; and these years being
  shortened in the proportion of four to seven, become 31 years; which
  subducted from <i>An.</i> 4, Olymp. 60, place the Conquest of
  <i>Cirrha</i> upon <i>An.</i> 1, Olymp. 53: and, by the like correction
  of the Marbles, <i>Alcmæon</i> entertained and conducted the messengers
  whom <i>Cr&#339;sus</i> sent to consult the Oracle at <i>Delphi</i>,
  <i>An.</i> 1, Olymp. 58; that is, four years before the Conquest of
  <i>Sardes</i> by <i>Cyrus</i>: and the Tyranny of <i>Pisistratus</i>,
  which by the Marbles began at <i>Athens</i>, <i>An.</i> 4, Olymp. 54, by
  the like correction began <i>An.</i> 3, Olymp. 57; and by consequence
  <i>Solon</i> died <i>An.</i> 4, Olymp. 57. This method may be used alone,
  where other arguments are wanting; but where they are not wanting, the
  best arguments are to be preferred.</p>

  <p><i>Iphitus</i> <a name="NtA_126" href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a>
  presided both in the Temple of <i>Jupiter Olympius</i>, and in the
  Olympic Games, and so did his Successors 'till the 26th Olympiad; and so
  long the victors were rewarded with a <i>Tripos</i>: but then the
  <i>Pisæans</i> getting above the <i>Eleans</i>, began to preside, and
  rewarded the victors with a Crown, and instituted the <i>Carnea</i> to
  <i>Apollo</i>; and continued to preside 'till <i>Phidon</i> interrupted
  them, that is, 'till about the time of the 49th Olympiad: for <a
  name="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> in the 48th Olympiad
  the <i>Eleans</i> entered the country of the <i>Pisæans</i>, suspecting
  their designs, but were prevailed upon to return home quietly; afterwards
  the <i>Pisæans</i> confederated with several other <i>Greek</i> nations,
  and made war upon the <i>Eleans</i>, and in the end were beaten: in this
  war I conceive it was that <i>Phidon</i> presided, suppose in the 49th
  Olympiad; for <a name="NtA_128" href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> in
  the 50th Olympiad, for putting an end to the contentions between the
  Kings about presiding, two men were chosen by lot out of the city
  <i>Elis</i> to preside, and their number in the 65th Olympiad was
  increased to nine, and afterwards to ten; and these judges were called
  <i>Hellenodicæ</i>, judges for or in the name of <i>Greece</i>.
  <i>Pausanias</i> tells us, that the <i>Eleans</i> called in <i>Phidon</i>
  and together with him celebrated the 8th Olympiad; he should have said
  the 49th Olympiad; but <i>Herodotus</i> tells us, that <i>Phidon</i>
  removed the <i>Eleans</i>; and both might be true: the <i>Eleans</i>
  might call in <i>Phidon</i> against the <i>Pisæans</i>, and upon
  overcoming be refused presiding in the Olympic games by <i>Phidon</i>,
  and confederate with the <i>Spartans</i>, and by their assistance
  overthrow the Kingdom of <i>Phidon</i>, and recover their ancient right
  of presiding in the games.</p>

  <p><i>Strabo</i> <a name="NtA_129" href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a>
  tells us that <i>Phidon</i> was the tenth from <i>Temenus</i>; not the
  tenth King, for between <i>Cisus</i> and <i>Phidon</i> they Reigned not,
  but the tenth from father to son, including <i>Temenus</i>. If 27 years
  be reckoned to a Generation by the eldest sons, the nine intervals will
  amount unto 243 years, which counted back from the 48th Olympiad, in
  which <i>Phidon</i> flourished, will place the Return of the
  <i>Heraclides</i> about fifty years before the beginning of the
  Olympiads, as above. But Chronologers reckon about 515 years from the
  Return of the <i>Heraclides</i> to the 48th Olympiad, and account
  <i>Phidon</i> the seventh from <i>Temenus</i>; which is after the rate of
  85 years to a Generation, and therefore not to be admitted.</p>

  <p><i>Cyrus</i> took <i>Babylon</i>, according to <i>Ptolomy</i>'s Canon,
  nine years before his death, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 209, <i>An.</i> 2,
  Olymp. 60: and he took <i>Sardes</i> a little before, namely <i>An.</i>
  1, Olymp. 59, as <i>Scaliger</i> collects from <i>Sosicrates</i>:
  <i>Cr&#339;sus</i> was then King of <i>Sardes</i>, and Reigned fourteen
  years, and therefore began to Reign <i>An.</i> 3, Olymp. 55. After
  <i>Solon</i> had made laws for the <i>Athenians</i>, he obliged them upon
  oath to observe those laws 'till he returned from his travels; and then
  travelled ten years, going to <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Cyprus</i>, and
  visiting <i>Thales</i> of <i>Miletus</i>: and upon His Return to
  <i>Athens</i>, <i>Pisistratus</i> began to affect the Tyranny of that
  city, which made <i>Solon</i> travel a second time; and now he was
  invited by <i>Cr&#339;sus</i> to <i>Sardes</i>; and <i>Cr&#339;sus</i>,
  before <i>Solon</i> visited him, had subdued all <i>Asia Minor</i>, as
  far as to the River <i>Halys</i>; and therefore he received that visit
  towards the latter part of his Reign; and we may place it upon the ninth
  year thereof, <i>An.</i> 3, Olymp. 57: and the legislature of
  <i>Solon</i> twelve years earlier, <i>An.</i> 3, Olymp. 54: and that of
  <i>Draco</i> still ten years earlier, <i>An.</i> 1, Olymp. 52. After
  <i>Solon</i> had visited <i>Cr&#339;sus</i>, he went into <i>Cilicia</i>
  and some other places, and died <a name="NtA_130"
  href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> in his travels: and this was in the
  second year of the Tyranny of <i>Pisistratus</i>. <i>Comias</i> was
  Archon when <i>Solon</i> returned from his first travels to
  <i>Athens</i>; and the next year <i>Hegestratus</i> was Archon, and
  <i>Solon</i> died before the end of the year, <i>An.</i> 3, Olymp. 57, as
  above: and by this reckoning the objection of <i>Plutarch</i> above
  mentioned is removed.</p>

  <p>We have now shewed that the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> of <i>Zidon</i>,
  under the conduct of <i>Cadmus</i> and other captains, flying from their
  enemies, came into <i>Greece</i>, with letters and other arts, about the
  sixteenth year of King <i>David</i>'s Reign; that <i>Europa</i> the
  sister of <i>Cadmus</i>, fled some days before him from <i>Zidon</i> and
  came to <i>Crete</i>, and there became the mother of <i>Minos</i>, about
  the 18th or 20th year of <i>David</i>'s Reign; that <i>Sesostris</i> and
  the great <i>Bacchus</i>, and by consequence also <i>Osiris</i>, were one
  and the same King of <i>Egypt</i> with <i>Sesac</i>, and came out of
  <i>Egypt</i> in the fifth year of <i>Rehoboam</i> to invade the nations,
  and died 25 years after <i>Solomon</i>; that the <i>Argonautic</i>
  expedition was about 43 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>; that
  <i>Troy</i> was taken about 76 or 78 years after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>; that the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> of <i>Tyre</i> were
  driven from the <i>Red Sea</i> by the <i>Edomites</i>, about 87 years
  after the death of <i>Solomon</i>, and within two or three years began to
  make long voyages upon the <i>Mediterranean</i>, sailing to <i>Spain</i>,
  and beyond, under a commander whom for his industry, conduct, and
  discoveries, they honoured with the names of <i>Melcartus</i> and
  <i>Hercules</i>; that the return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into
  <i>Peloponnesus</i> was about 158 years after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>; that <i>Lycurgus</i> the Legislator Reigned at
  <i>Sparta</i>, and gave the three Discs to the Olympic treasury,
  <i>An.</i> 1, Olymp. 18, or 273 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>,
  the <i>Quinquertium</i> being at that time added to the Olympic Games;
  that the <i>Greeks</i> began soon after to build <i>Triremes</i>, and to
  send Colonies into <i>Sicily</i> and <i>Italy</i>, which gave the name of
  <i>Græcia magna</i> to those countries; that the first <i>Messenian</i>
  war ended about 350 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>, <i>An.</i>
  1, Olymp. 37; that <i>Phidon</i> was contemporary to <i>Solon</i>, and
  presided in the Olympic Games in the 49th Olympiad, that is, 397 years
  after the death of <i>Solomon</i>; that <i>Draco</i> was Archon, and made
  his laws, <i>An.</i> 1, Olymp. 52; and <i>Solon</i>, <i>An.</i> 3, Olymp.
  54; and that <i>Solon</i> visited <i>Cr&#339;sus</i> <i>Ann.</i> 3,
  Olymp. 57, or 433 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>; and
  <i>Sardes</i> was taken by <i>Cyrus</i> 438 years, and <i>Babylon</i> by
  <i>Cyrus</i> 443 years, and <i>Echatane</i> by <i>Cyrus</i> 445 years
  after the death of <i>Solomon</i>: and these periods being settled, they
  become a foundation for building the Chronology of the antient times upon
  them; and nothing more remains for settling such a Chronology, than to
  make these Periods a little exacter, if it can be, and to shew how the
  rest of the Antiquities of <i>Greece</i>, <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Assyria</i>,
  <i>Chaldæa</i>, and <i>Media</i> may suit therewith.</p>

  <p>Whilst <i>Bacchus</i> made his expedition into <i>India</i>,
  <i>Theseus</i> left <i>Ariadne</i> in the Island <i>Naxus</i> or
  <i>Dia</i>, as above, and succeeded his father <i>Ægeus</i> at
  <i>Athens</i>; and upon the Return of <i>Bacchus</i> from <i>India</i>,
  <i>Ariadne</i> became his mistress, and accompanied him in his triumphs;
  and this was about ten years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>: and from
  that time reigned eight Kings in <i>Athens</i>, viz. <i>Theseus</i>,
  <i>Menestheus</i>, <i>Demophoon</i>, <i>Oxyntes</i>, <i>Aphidas</i>,
  <i>Thymætes</i>, <i>Melanthus</i>, and <i>Codrus</i>; these Kings, at 19
  years a-piece one with another, might take up about 152 years, and end
  about 44 years before the Olympiads: then Reigned twelve Archons for
  life, which at 14 or 15 years a-piece, the State being unstable, might
  take up about 174 years, and end <i>An.</i> 2, Olymp. 33: then reigned
  seven decennial Archons, which are usually reckoned at seventy years; but
  some of them dying in their Regency, they might not take up above forty
  years, and so end about <i>An.</i> 2, Olymp. 43, about which time began
  the Second <i>Messenian</i> war: these decennial Archons were followed by
  the annual Archons, amongst whom were the Legislators <i>Draco</i> and
  <i>Solon</i>. Soon after the death of <i>Codrus</i>, his second Son
  <i>Neleus</i>, not bearing the Reign of his lame brother <i>Medon</i> at
  <i>Athens</i>, retired into <i>Asia</i>, and was followed by his younger
  brothers <i>Androcles</i> and <i>Cyaretus</i>, and many others: these had
  the name of <i>Ionians</i>, from <i>Ion</i> the son of <i>Xuthus</i>, who
  commanded the army of the <i>Athenians</i> at the death of
  <i>Erechtheus</i>, and gave the name of <i>Ionia</i> to the country which
  they invaded: and about 20 or 25 years after the death of <i>Codrus</i>,
  these new Colonies, being now Lords of <i>Ionia</i>, set up over
  themselves a common Council called <i>Panionium</i>, and composed of
  Counsellors sent from twelve of their cities, <i>Miletus</i>,
  <i>Myus</i>, <i>Priene</i>, <i>Ephesus</i>, <i>Colophon</i>,
  <i>Lebedus</i>, <i>Teos</i>, <i>Clazomenæ</i>, <i>Phocæa</i>,
  <i>Samos</i>, <i>Chios</i>, and <i>Erythræa</i>: and this was the
  <i>Ionic</i> Migration.</p>

  <p><a name="NtA_131" href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> When the
  <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latines</i> were forming their Technical Chronology,
  there were great disputes about the Antiquity of <i>Rome</i>: the
  <i>Greeks</i> made it much older than the Olympiads: some of them said it
  was built by <i>Æneas</i>; others, by <i>Romus</i>, the son or grandson
  of <i>Æneas</i>; others, by <i>Romus</i>, the son or grandson of
  <i>Latinus</i> King of the <i>Aborigines</i>; others, by <i>Romus</i> the
  son of <i>Ulysses</i>, or of <i>Ascanius</i>, or of <i>Italus</i>: and
  some of the <i>Latines</i> at first fell in with the opinion of the
  <i>Greeks</i>, saying that it was built by <i>Romulus</i>, the son or
  grandson of <i>Æneas</i>. <i>Timæus Siculus</i> represented it built by
  <i>Romulus</i>, the grandson of <i>Æneas</i>, above an hundred years
  before the Olympiads; and so did <i>Nævius</i> the Poet, who was twenty
  years older than <i>Ennius</i>, and served in the first <i>Punic</i> war,
  and wrote the history of that war. Hitherto nothing certain was agreed
  upon, but about 140 or 150 years after the death of <i>Alexander the
  Great</i>, they began to say that <i>Rome</i> was built a second time by
  <i>Romulus</i>, in the fifteenth Age after the destruction of
  <i>Troy</i>: by Ages they meant Reigns of the Kings of the <i>Latines</i>
  at <i>Alba</i>, and reckoned the first fourteen Reigns at about 432
  years, and the following Reigns of the seven Kings of <i>Rome</i> at 244
  years, both which numbers made up the time of about 676 years from the
  taking of <i>Troy</i>, according to these Chronologers; but are much too
  long for the course of nature: and by this reckoning they placed the
  building of <i>Rome</i> upon the sixth or seventh Olympiad; <i>Varro</i>
  placed it on the first year of the Seventh Olympiad, and was therein
  generally followed by the <i>Romans</i>; but this can scarce be
  reconciled to the course of nature: for I do not meet with any instance
  in all history, since Chronology was certain, wherein seven Kings, most
  of whom were slain, Reigned 244 years in continual Succession. The
  fourteen Reigns of the Kings of the <i>Latines</i>, at twenty years
  a-piece one with another, amount unto 280 years, and these years counted
  from the taking of <i>Troy</i> end in the 38th Olympiad: and the Seven
  Reigns of the Kings of <i>Rome</i>, four or five of them being slain and
  one deposed, may at a moderate reckoning amount to fifteen or sixteen
  years a-piece one with another: let them be reckoned at seventeen years
  a-piece, and they will amount unto 119 years; which being counted
  backwards from the Regifuge, end also in the 38th Olympiad: and by these
  two reckonings <i>Rome</i> was built in the 38th Olympiad, or thereabout.
  The 280 years and the 119 years together make up 399 years; and the same
  number of years arises by counting the twenty and one Reigns at nineteen
  years a-piece: and this being the whole time between the taking of
  <i>Troy</i> and the Regifuge, let these years be counted backward from
  the Regifuge, <i>An.</i> 1, Olymp. 68, and they will place the taking of
  <i>Troy</i> about 74 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

  <p>When <i>Sesostris</i> returned from <i>Thrace</i> into <i>Egypt</i>,
  he left <i>Æetes</i> with part of his army in <i>Colchis</i>, to guard
  that pass; and <i>Phryxus</i> and his sister <i>Helle</i> fled from
  <i>Ino</i>, the daughter of <i>Cadmus</i>, to <i>Æetes</i> soon after, in
  a ship whose ensign was a golden ram: <i>Ino</i> was therefore alive in
  the fourteenth year of <i>Rehoboam</i>, the year in which
  <i>Sesostris</i> returned into <i>Egypt</i>; and by consequence her
  father <i>Cadmus</i> flourished in the Reign of <i>David</i>, and not
  before. <i>Cadmus</i> was the father of <i>Polydorus</i>, the father of
  <i>Labdacus</i>, the father of <i>Laius</i>, the father of
  <i>Oedipus</i>, the father of <i>Eteocles</i> and <i>Polynices</i> who
  slew one another in their youth, in the war of the seven Captains at
  <i>Thebes</i>, about ten or twelve years after the <i>Argonautic</i>
  Expedition: and <i>Thersander</i>, the son of <i>Polynices</i>, warred at
  <i>Troy</i>. These Generations being by the eldest sons who married
  young, if they be reckoned at about twenty and four years to a
  Generation, will place the birth of <i>Polydorus</i> upon the 18th year
  of <i>David</i>'s Reign, or thereabout: and thus <i>Cadmus</i> might be a
  young man, not yet married, when he came first into <i>Greece</i>. At his
  first coming he sail'd to <i>Rhodes</i>, and thence to <i>Samothrace</i>,
  an Island near <i>Thrace</i> on the north side of <i>Lemnos</i>, and
  there married <i>Harmonia</i>, the sister of <i>Jasius</i> and
  <i>Dardanus</i>, which gave occasion to the <i>Samothracian</i>
  mysteries: and <i>Polydorus</i> might be their son, born a year or two
  after their coming; and his sister <i>Europa</i> might be then a young
  woman, in the flower of her age. These Generations cannot well be
  shorter; and therefore <i>Cadmus</i>, and his son <i>Polydorus</i>, were
  not younger than we have reckoned them: nor can they be much longer,
  without making <i>Polydorus</i> too old to be born in <i>Europe</i>, and
  to be the son of <i>Harmonia</i> the sister of <i>Jasius</i>.
  <i>Labdacus</i> was therefore born in the end of <i>David</i>'s Reign,
  <i>Laius</i> in the 24th year of <i>Solomon</i>'s, and <i>Oedipus</i> in
  the seventh of <i>Rehoboam</i>'s, or thereabout: unless you had rather
  say, that <i>Polydorus</i> was born at <i>Zidon</i>, before his father
  came into <i>Europe</i>; but his name <i>Polydorus</i> is in the language
  of <i>Greece</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Polydorus</i> married <i>Nycteis</i>, the daughter of
  <i>Nycteus</i> a native of <i>Greece</i>, and dying young, left his
  Kingdom and young son <i>Labdacus</i> under the administration of
  <i>Nycteus</i>. Then <i>Epopeus</i> King of <i>Ægialus</i>, afterwards
  called <i>Sicyon</i>, stole <i>Antiope</i> the daughter of
  <i>Nycteus</i>, <a name="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> and
  <i>Nycteus</i> thereupon made war upon him, and in a battle wherein
  <i>Nycteus</i> overcame, both were wounded and died soon after.
  <i>Nycteus</i> left the tuition of <i>Labdacus</i>, and administration of
  the Kingdom, to his brother <i>Lycus</i>; and <i>Epopeus</i> or, as
  <i>Hyginus</i> <a name="NtA_133" href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>
  calls him, <i>Epaphus</i> the <i>Sicyonian</i>, left his Kingdom to
  <i>Lamedon</i>, who presently ended the war, by sending home
  <i>Antiope</i>: and she, in returning home, brought forth <i>Amphion</i>
  and <i>Zethus</i>. <i>Labdacus</i> being grown up received the Kingdom
  from <i>Lycus</i>, and soon after dying left it again to his
  administration, for his young son <i>Laius</i>. When <i>Amphion</i> and
  <i>Zethus</i> were about twenty years old, at the instigation of their
  mother <i>Antiope</i>, they killed <i>Lycus</i>, and made <i>Laius</i>
  flee to <i>Pelops</i>, and seized the city <i>Thebes</i>, and compassed
  it with a wall; and <i>Amphion</i> married <i>Niobe</i> the sister of
  <i>Pelops</i>, and by her had several children, amongst whom was
  <i>Chloris</i>, the mother of <i>Periclymenus</i> the <i>Argonaut</i>.
  <i>Pelops</i> was the father of <i>Plisthenes</i>, <i>Atreus</i>, and
  <i>Thyestes</i>; and <i>Agamemnon</i> and <i>Menelaus</i>, the adopted
  sons of <i>Atreus</i>, warred at <i>Troy</i>. <i>Ægisthus</i>, the son of
  <i>Thyestes</i>, slew <i>Agamemnon</i> the year after the taking of
  <i>Troy</i>; and <i>Atreus</i> died just before <i>Paris</i> stole
  <i>Helena</i>, which, according to <a name="NtA_134"
  href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> <i>Homer</i>, was twenty years before
  the taking of <i>Troy</i>. <i>Deucalion</i> the son of <i>Minos</i>, <a
  name="NtA_135" href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> was an
  <i>Argonaut</i>; and <i>Talus</i> another son of <i>Minos</i>, was slain
  by the <i>Argonauts</i>; and <i>Idomeneus</i> and <i>Meriones</i> the
  grandsons of <i>Minos</i> were at the <i>Trojan</i> war. All these things
  confirm the ages of <i>Cadmus</i> and <i>Europa</i>, and their posterity,
  above assigned, and place the death of <i>Epopeus</i> or <i>Epaphus</i>
  King of <i>Sicyon</i>, and birth of <i>Amphion</i> and <i>Zethus</i>,
  upon the tenth year of <i>Solomon</i>; and the taking of <i>Thebes</i> by
  <i>Amphion</i> and <i>Zethus</i>, and the flight of <i>Laius</i> to
  <i>Pelops</i>, upon the thirtieth year of that King, or thereabout.
  <i>Amphion</i> might marry the sister of <i>Pelops</i>, the same year,
  and <i>Pelops</i> come into <i>Greece</i> three or four years before that
  flight, or about the 26th year of <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

  <p>In the days of <i>Erechtheus</i> King of <i>Athens</i>, and
  <i>Celeus</i> King of <i>Eleusis</i>, <i>Ceres</i> came into
  <i>Attica</i>; and educated <i>Triptolemus</i> the son of <i>Celeus</i>,
  and taught him to sow corn. She <a name="NtA_136"
  href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> lay with <i>Jasion</i>, or
  <i>Jasius</i>, the brother of <i>Harmonia</i> the wife of <i>Cadmus</i>;
  and presently after her death <i>Erechtheus</i> was slain, in a war
  between the <i>Athenians</i> and <i>Eleusinians</i>; and, for the
  benefaction of bringing tillage into <i>Greece</i>, the <i>Eleusinia
  Sacra</i> were instituted to her <a name="NtA_137"
  href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> with <i>Egyptian</i> ceremonies, by
  <i>Celeus</i> and <i>Eumolpus</i>; and a Sepulchre or Temple was erected
  to her in <i>Eleusine</i>, and in this Temple the families of
  <i>Celeus</i> and <i>Eumolpus</i> became her Priests: and this Temple,
  and that which <i>Eurydice</i> erected to her daughter <i>Danae</i>, by
  the name of <i>Juno Argiva</i>, are the first instances that I meet with
  in <i>Greece</i> of Deifying the dead, with Temples, and Sacred Rites,
  and Sacrifices, and Initiations, and a succession of Priests to perform
  them. Now by this history it is manifest that <i>Erechtheus</i>,
  <i>Celeus</i>, <i>Eumolpus</i>, <i>Ceres</i>, <i>Jasius</i>,
  <i>Cadmus</i>, <i>Harmonia</i>, <i>Asterius</i>, and <i>Dardanus</i> the
  brother of <i>Jasius</i>, and one of the founders of the Kingdom of
  <i>Troy</i>, were all contemporary to one another, and flourished in
  their youth, when <i>Cadmus</i> came first into <i>Europe</i>.
  <i>Erechtheus</i> could not be much older, because his daughter
  <i>Procris</i> convers'd with <i>Minos</i> King of <i>Crete</i>; and his
  grandson <i>Thespis</i> had fifty daughters, who lay with
  <i>Hercules</i>; and his daughter <i>Orithyia</i> was the mother of
  <i>Calais</i> and <i>Zetes</i>, two of the <i>Argonauts</i> in their
  youth; and his son <i>Orneus</i> <a name="NtA_138"
  href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> was the father of <i>Peteos</i> the
  father of <i>Menestheus</i>, who warred at <i>Troy</i>: nor much younger,
  because his second son <i>Pandion</i>, who with the <i>Metionides</i>
  deposed his elder brother <i>Cecrops</i>, was the father of <i>Ægeus</i>,
  the father of <i>Theseus</i>; and <i>Metion</i>, another of his sons, was
  the father of <i>Eupalamus</i>, the father of <i>Dædalus</i>, who was
  older than <i>Theseus</i>; and his daughter <i>Creusa</i> married
  <i>Xuthus</i>, the son of <i>Hellen</i>, and by him had two sons,
  <i>Achæus</i> and <i>Ion</i>; and <i>Ion</i> commanded the army of the
  <i>Athenians</i> against the <i>Eleusinians</i>, in the battle in which
  his grandfather <i>Erechtheus</i> was slain: and this was just before the
  institution of the <i>Eleusinia Sacra</i>, and before the Reign of
  <i>Pandion</i> the father of <i>Ægeus</i>. <i>Erechtheus</i> being an
  <i>Egyptian</i> procured corn from <i>Egypt</i>, and for that benefaction
  was made King of <i>Athens</i>; and near the beginning of his Reign
  <i>Ceres</i> came into <i>Attica</i> from <i>Sicily</i>, in quest of her
  daughter <i>Proserpina</i>. We cannot err much if we make <i>Hellen</i>
  contemporary to the Reign of <i>Saul</i>, and to that of <i>David</i> at
  <i>Hebron</i>; and place the beginning of the Reign of <i>Erechtheus</i>
  in the 25th year, the coming of <i>Ceres</i> into <i>Attica</i> in the
  30th year, and the dispersion of corn by <i>Triptolemus</i> about the
  40th year of <i>David</i>'s Reign; and the death of <i>Ceres</i> and
  <i>Erechtheus</i>, and institution of the <i>Eleusinia Sacra</i>, between
  the tenth and fifteenth year of <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Teucer</i>, <i>Dardanus</i>, <i>Erichthonius</i>, <i>Tros</i>,
  <i>Ilus</i>, <i>Laomedon</i>, and <i>Priamus</i> Reigned successively at
  <i>Troy</i>; and their Reigns, at about twenty years a-piece one with
  another, amount unto an hundred and forty years: which counted back from
  the taking of <i>Troy</i>, place the beginning of the Reign of
  <i>Teucer</i> about the fifteenth year of the Reign of King <i>David</i>;
  and that of <i>Dardanus</i>, in the days of <i>Ceres</i>, who lay with
  <i>Jasius</i> the brother of <i>Dardanus</i>: whereas Chronologers reckon
  that the six last of these Kings Reigned 296 years, which is after the
  rate of 49&#x2153; years a-piece one with another; and that they began
  their Reign in the days of <i>Moses</i>. <i>Dardanus</i> married the
  daughter of <i>Teucer</i>, the Son of <i>Scamander</i>, and succeeded
  him: whence <i>Teucer</i> was of about the same age with
  <i>David</i>.</p>

  <p>Upon the return of <i>Sesostris</i> into <i>Egypt</i>, his brother
  <i>Danaus</i> not only attempted his life, as above, but also commanded
  his daughters, who were fifty in number and had married the sons of
  <i>Sesostris</i>, to slay their husbands; and then fled with his
  daughters from <i>Egypt</i>, in a long ship of fifty oars. This Flight
  was in the fourteenth year of <i>Rehoboam</i>. <i>Danaus</i> came first
  to <i>Lindus</i>, a town in <i>Rhodes</i>, and there built a Temple, and
  erected a Statue to <i>Minerva</i>, and lost three of his daughters by a
  plague which raged there; and then sailed thence with the rest of his
  daughters to <i>Argos</i>. He came to <i>Argos</i> therefore in the
  fifteenth or sixteenth year of <i>Rehoboam</i>: and at length contending
  there with <i>Gelanor</i> the brother of <i>Eurystheus</i> for the crown
  of <i>Argos</i>, was chosen by the people, and Reigned at <i>Argos</i>,
  while <i>Eurystheus</i> Reigned at <i>Mycenæ</i>; and <i>Eurystheus</i>
  was born <a name="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> the same
  year with <i>Hercules</i>. <i>Gelanor</i> and <i>Eurystheus</i> were the
  sons of <i>Sthenelus</i>, by <i>Nicippe</i> the daughter of
  <i>Pelops</i>; and <i>Sthenelus</i> was the son of <i>Perseus</i>, and
  Reigned at <i>Argos</i>, and <i>Danaus</i>, who succeeded him at
  <i>Argos</i>, was succeeded there by his son in law <i>Lynceus</i>, and
  he by his son <i>Abas</i>; that <i>Abas</i> who is commonly, but
  erroneously, reputed the father of <i>Acrisius</i> and <i>Prætus</i>. In
  the time of the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition <i>Castor</i> and
  <i>Pollux</i> were beardless young men, and their sisters <i>Helena</i>
  and <i>Clytemnestra</i> were children, and their wives <i>Ph&#339;be</i>
  and <i>Ilaira</i> were also very young: all these, with the
  <i>Argonauts</i> <i>Lynceus</i> and <i>Idas</i>, were the grandchildren
  of <i>Gorgophone</i>, the daughter of <i>Perseus</i>, the son of
  <i>Danae</i>, the daughter of <i>Acrisius</i> and <i>Eurydice</i>; and
  <i>Perieres</i> and <i>Oebalus</i>, the husbands of <i>Gorgophone</i>,
  were the sons of <i>Cynortes</i>, the son of <i>Amyclas</i>, the brother
  of <i>Eurydice</i>. <i>Mestor</i> or <i>Mastor</i>, the brother of
  <i>Sthenelus</i>, married <i>Lysidice</i>, another of the daughters of
  <i>Pelops</i>: and <i>Pelops</i> married <i>Hippodamia</i>, the daughter
  of <i>Evarete</i>, the daughter of <i>Acrisius</i>. <i>Alcmena</i>, the
  mother of <i>Hercules</i>, was the daughter of <i>Electryo</i>; and
  <i>Sthenelus</i>, <i>Mestor</i> and <i>Electryo</i> were brothers of
  <i>Gorgophone</i>, and sons of <i>Perseus</i> and <i>Andromeda</i>: and
  the <i>Argonaut</i> <i>Æsculapius</i> was the grandson of
  <i>Leucippus</i> and <i>Phlegia</i>, and <i>Leucippus</i> was the son of
  <i>Perieres</i>, the grandson of <i>Amyclas</i> the brother of
  <i>Eurydice</i>, and <i>Amyclas</i> and <i>Eurydice</i> were the children
  of <i>Lacedæmon</i> and <i>Sparta</i>: and <i>Capaneus</i>, one of the
  seven Captains against <i>Thebes</i>, was the husband of <i>Euadne</i>
  the daughter of <i>Iphis</i>, the son of <i>Elector</i>, the son of
  <i>Anaxagoras</i>, the son of <i>Megapenthes</i>, the son of
  <i>Prætus</i> the brother of <i>Acrisius</i>. Now from these Generations
  it may be gathered that <i>Perseus</i>, <i>Perieres</i> and
  <i>Anaxagoras</i> were of about the same age with <i>Minos</i>,
  <i>Pelops</i>, <i>Ægeus</i> and <i>Sesac</i>; and that <i>Acrisius</i>,
  <i>Prætus</i>, <i>Eurydice</i>, and <i>Amyclas</i>, being two little
  Generations older, were of about the same age with King <i>David</i> and
  <i>Erechtheus</i>; and that the Temple of <i>Juno Argiva</i> was built
  about the same time with the Temple of <i>Solomon</i>; the same being
  built by <i>Eurydice</i> to her daughter <i>Danae</i>, as above; or as
  some say, by <i>Pirasus</i> or <i>Piranthus</i>, the son or successor of
  <i>Argus</i>, and great grandson of <i>Phoroneus</i>: for the first
  Priestess of that Goddess was <i>Callithea</i> the daughter of
  <i>Piranthus</i>; <i>Callithea</i> was succeeded by <i>Alcinoe</i>, about
  three Generations before the taking of <i>Troy</i>, that is about the
  middle of <i>Solomon</i>'s Reign: in her Priesthood the <i>Siculi</i>
  passed out of <i>Italy</i> into <i>Sicily</i>: afterwards
  <i>Hypermnestra</i> the daughter of <i>Danaus</i> became Priestess of
  this Goddess, and she flourished in the times next before the
  <i>Argonautic</i> expedition: and <i>Admeta</i>, the daughter of
  <i>Eurystheus</i>, was Priestess of this <i>Juno</i> about the times of
  the <i>Trojan</i> war. <i>Andromeda</i> the wife of <i>Perseus</i>, was
  the daughter of <i>Cepheus</i> an <i>Egyptian</i>, the son of
  <i>Belus</i>, according to <a name="NtA_140"
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> <i>Herodotus</i>; and the
  <i>Egyptian</i> <i>Belus</i> was <i>Ammon</i>: <i>Perseus</i> took her
  from <i>Joppa</i>, where <i>Cepheus</i>, I think a kinsman of
  <i>Solomon</i>'s Queen, resided in the days of <i>Solomon</i>.
  <i>Acrisius</i> and <i>Prætus</i> were the sons of <i>Abas</i>: but this
  <i>Abas</i> was not the same man with <i>Abas</i> the grandson of
  <i>Danaus</i>, but a much older Prince, who built <i>Abæa</i> in
  <i>Phocis</i>, and might be the Prince from whom the island
  <i>Eub&#339;a</i> <a name="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a>
  was anciently called <i>Abantis</i>, and the people thereof
  <i>Abantes</i>: for <i>Apollonius Rhodius</i> <a name="NtA_142"
  href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> tells us, that the <i>Argonaut</i>
  <i>Canthus</i> was the son of <i>Canethus</i>, and that <i>Canethus</i>
  was of the posterity of <i>Abas</i>; and the Commentator upon
  <i>Apollonius</i> tells us further, that from this <i>Abas</i> the
  inhabitants of <i>Eub&#339;a</i> were anciently called <i>Abantes</i>.
  This <i>Abas</i> therefore flourished three or four Generations before
  the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition, and so might be the father of
  <i>Acrisius</i>: the ancestors of <i>Acrisius</i> were accounted
  <i>Egyptians</i> by the <i>Greeks</i>, and they might come from
  <i>Egypt</i> under <i>Abas</i> into <i>Eub&#339;a</i>, and from thence
  into <i>Peloponnesus</i>. I do not reckon <i>Phorbas</i> and his son
  <i>Triopas</i> among the Kings of <i>Argos</i>, because they fled from
  that Kingdom to the Island <i>Rhodes</i>; nor do I reckon <i>Crotopus</i>
  among them, because because he went from <i>Argos</i>, and built a new
  city for himself in <i>Megaris</i>, as <a name="NtA_143"
  href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> <i>Conon</i> relates.</p>

  <p>We said that <i>Pelops</i> came into <i>Greece</i> about the 26th year
  of <i>Solomon</i>: he <a name="NtA_144"
  href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> came thither in the days of
  <i>Acrisius</i>, and in those of <i>Endymion</i>, and of his sons, and
  took <i>Ætolia</i> from <i>Aetolus</i>. <i>Endymion</i> was the son of
  <i>Aëthlius</i>, the son of <i>Protogenia</i>, the sister of
  <i>Hellen</i>, and daughter of <i>Deucalion</i>: <i>Phrixus</i> and
  <i>Helle</i>, the children of <i>Athamus</i>, the brother of
  <i>Sisyphus</i> and Son of <i>Æolus</i>, the son of <i>Hellen</i>, fled
  from their stepmother <i>Ino</i>, the daughter of <i>Cadmus</i>, to
  <i>Æetes</i> in <i>Colchis</i>, presently after the return of
  <i>Sesostris</i> into <i>Egypt</i>: and <i>Jason</i> the <i>Argonaut</i>
  was the son of <i>Æson</i>, the son of <i>Cretheus</i>, the son of
  <i>Æolus</i>, the son of <i>Hellen</i>: and <i>Calyce</i> was the wife of
  <i>Aëthlius</i>, and mother of <i>Endymion</i>, and daughter of
  <i>Æolus</i>, and sister of <i>Cretheus</i>, <i>Sisyphus</i> and
  <i>Athamas</i>: and by these circumstances <i>Cretheus</i>,
  <i>Sisyphus</i> and <i>Athamas</i> flourished in the latter part of the
  Reign of <i>Solomon</i>, and in the Reign of <i>Rehoboam</i>:
  <i>Aëthlius</i>, <i>Æolus</i>, <i>Xuthus</i>, <i>Dorus</i>,
  <i>Tantalus</i>, and <i>Danae</i> were contemporary to <i>Erechtheus</i>,
  <i>Jasius</i> and <i>Cadmus</i>; and <i>Hellen</i> was about one, and
  <i>Deucalion</i> about two Generations older than <i>Erechtheus</i>. They
  could not be much older, because <i>Xuthus</i> the youngest son of
  <i>Hellen</i> <a name="NtA_145" href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a>
  married <i>Creusa</i> the daughter of <i>Erechtheus</i>; nor could they
  be much younger, because <i>Cephalus</i> the son of <i>Deioneus</i>, the
  son of <i>Æolus</i>, the eldest son of <i>Hellen</i>, <a name="NtA_146"
  href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> married <i>Procris</i> the daughter
  of <i>Erechtheus</i>; and <i>Procris</i> fled from her husband to
  <i>Minos</i>. Upon the death of <i>Hellen</i>, his youngest son
  <i>Xuthus</i> <a name="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> was
  expelled <i>Thessaly</i> by his brothers <i>Æolus</i> and <i>Dorus</i>,
  and fled to <i>Erechtheus</i>, and married <i>Creusa</i> the daughter of
  <i>Erechtheus</i>; by whom he had two sons, <i>Achæus</i> and <i>Ion</i>,
  the youngest of which grew up before the death of <i>Erechtheus</i>, and
  commanded the army of the <i>Athenians</i>, in the war in which
  <i>Erechtheus</i> was slain: and therefore <i>Hellen</i> died about one
  Generation before <i>Erechtheus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Sisyphus</i> therefore built <i>Corinth</i> about the latter end of
  the Reign of <i>Solomon</i>, or the beginning of the Reign of
  <i>Rehoboam</i>. Upon the flight of <i>Phrixus</i> and <i>Helle</i>,
  their father <i>Athamas</i>, a little King in <i>B&#339;otia</i>, went
  distracted and slew his son <i>Learchus</i>; and his wife <i>Ino</i>
  threw her self into the sea, together with her other son
  <i>Melicertus</i>; and thereupon <i>Sisyphus</i> instituted the
  <i>Isthmia</i> at <i>Corinth</i> to his nephew <i>Melicertus</i>. This
  was presently after <i>Sesostris</i> had left <i>Æetes</i> in
  <i>Colchis</i>, I think in the fifteenth or sixteenth year of
  <i>Rehoboam</i>: so that <i>Athamas</i>, the son of <i>Æolus</i> and
  grandson of <i>Hellen</i>, and <i>Ino</i> the daughter of <i>Cadmus</i>,
  flourished 'till about the sixteenth year of <i>Rehoboam</i>.
  <i>Sisyphus</i> and his successors <i>Ornytion</i>, <i>Thoas</i>,
  <i>Demophon</i>, <i>Propodas</i>, <i>Doridas</i>, and <i>Hyanthidas</i>
  Reigned successively at <i>Corinth</i>, 'till the return of the
  <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i>: then Reigned the
  <i>Heraclides</i>, <i>Aletes</i>, <i>Ixion</i>, <i>Agelas</i>,
  <i>Prumnis</i>, <i>Bacchis</i>, <i>Agelas II</i>, <i>Eudamus</i>,
  <i>Aristodemus</i>, and <i>Telestes</i> successively about 170 years, and
  then <i>Corinth</i> was governed by <i>Prytanes</i> or annual Archons
  about 42 years, and after them by <i>Cypselus</i> and <i>Periander</i>
  about 48 years more.</p>

  <p><i>Celeus</i> King of <i>Eleusis</i>, who was contemporary to
  <i>Erechtheus</i>, <a name="NtA_148" href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a>
  was the son of <i>Rharus</i>, the son of <i>Cranaus</i>, the successor of
  <i>Cecrops</i>; and in the Reign of <i>Cranaus</i>, <i>Deucalion</i> fled
  with his sons <i>Hellen</i> and <i>Amphictyon</i> from the flood which
  then overflowed <i>Thessaly</i>, and was called <i>Deucalion</i>'s flood:
  they fled into <i>Attica</i>, and there <i>Deucalion</i> died soon after;
  and <i>Pausanias</i> tells us that his Sepulchre was to be seen near
  <i>Athens</i>. His eldest son <i>Hellen</i> succeeded him in
  <i>Thessaly</i>, and his other son <i>Amphictyon</i> married the daughter
  of <i>Cranaus</i>, and Reigning at <i>Thermopylæ</i>, erected there the
  <i>Amphictyonic</i> Council; and <i>Acrisius</i> soon after erected the
  like Council at <i>Delphi</i>. This I conceive was done when
  <i>Amphictyon</i> and <i>Acrisius</i> were aged, and fit to be
  Counsellors; suppose in the latter half of the Reign of <i>David</i>, and
  beginning of the Reign of <i>Solomon</i>; and soon after, suppose about
  the middle of the Reign of <i>Solomon</i>, did <i>Phemonoë</i> become the
  first Priestess of <i>Apollo</i> at <i>Delphi</i>, and gave Oracles in
  hexameter verse: and then was <i>Acrisius</i> slain accidentally by his
  grandson <i>Perseus</i>. The Council of <i>Thermopylæ</i> included twelve
  nations of the <i>Greeks</i>, without <i>Attica</i>, and therefore
  <i>Amphictyon</i> did not then Reign at <i>Athens</i>: he might endeavour
  to succeed <i>Cranaus</i>, his wife's father, and be prevented by
  <i>Erechtheus</i>.</p>

  <p>Between the Reigns of <i>Cranaus</i> and <i>Erechtheus</i>,
  Chronologers place also <i>Erichthonius</i>, and his son <i>Pandion</i>;
  but I take this <i>Erichthonius</i> and this his son <i>Pandion</i>, to
  be the same with <i>Erechtheus</i> and his son and successor
  <i>Pandion</i>, the names being only repeated with a little variation in
  the list of the Kings of <i>Attica</i>: for <i>Erichthonius</i>, he that
  was the son of the Earth, nursed up by <i>Minerva</i>, is by <i>Homer</i>
  called <i>Erechtheus</i>; and <i>Themistius</i> <a name="NtA_149"
  href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> tells us, that it was
  <i>Erechtheus</i> that first joyned a chariot to horses; and <i>Plato</i>
  <a name="NtA_150" href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> alluding to the
  story of <i>Erichthonius</i> in a basket, saith, <i>The people of
  magnanimous </i>Erechtheus<i> is beautiful, but it behoves us to behold
  him taken out</i>: <i>Erechtheus</i> therefore immediately succeeded
  <i>Cranaus</i>, while <i>Amphictyon</i> Reigned at <i>Thermopylæ</i>. In
  the Reign of <i>Cranaus</i> the Poets place the flood of
  <i>Deucalion</i>, and therefore the death of <i>Deucalion</i>, and the
  Reign of his sons <i>Hellen</i> and <i>Amphictyon</i>, in <i>Thessaly</i>
  and <i>Thermpolyæ</i>, was but a few years, suppose eight or ten, before
  the Reign of <i>Erechtheus</i>.</p>

  <p>The first Kings of <i>Arcadia</i> were successively <i>Pelasgus</i>,
  <i>Lycaon</i>, <i>Nyctimus</i>, <i>Arcas</i>, <i>Clitor</i>,
  <i>Æpytus</i>, <i>Aleus</i>, <i>Lycurgus</i>, <i>Echemus</i>,
  <i>Agapenor</i>, <i>Hippothous</i>, <i>Æpytus</i> II, <i>Cypselus</i>,
  <i>Olæas</i>, &amp;c. Under <i>Cypselus</i> the <i>Heraclides</i>
  returned into <i>Peloponnesus</i>, as above: <i>Agapenor</i> was one of
  those who courted <i>Helena</i>; he courted her before he reigned, and
  afterwards he went to the war at <i>Troy</i>, and thence to
  <i>Cyprus</i>, and there built <i>Paphos</i>. <i>Echemus</i> slew
  <i>Hyllus</i> the son of <i>Hercules.</i> <i>Lycurgus</i>,
  <i>Cepheus</i>, and <i>Auge</i>, were <a name="NtA_151"
  href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> the children of <i>Aleus</i>, the son
  of <i>Aphidas</i>, the son of <i>Arcas</i>, the son of <i>Callisto</i>,
  the daughter of <i>Lycaon</i>: <i>Auge</i> lay with <i>Hercules</i>, and
  <i>Ancæus</i> the son of <i>Lycurgus</i> was an <i>Argonaut</i>, and his
  uncle <i>Cepheus</i> was his Governour in that Expedition; and
  <i>Lycurgus</i> stay'd at home, to look after his aged father
  <i>Aleus</i>, who might be born about 75 years before that Expedition;
  and his grandfather <i>Arcas</i> might be born about the end of the Reign
  of <i>Saul</i>, and <i>Lycaon</i> the grandfather of <i>Arcas</i> might
  be then alive, and dye before the middle of <i>David</i>'s Reign; and His
  youngest son <i>Oenotrus</i>, the <i>Janus</i> of the <i>Latines</i>,
  might grow up, and lead a colony into <i>Italy</i> before the Reign of
  <i>Solomon</i>. <i>Arcas</i> received <a name="NtA_152"
  href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> bread-corn from <i>Triptolemus</i>,
  and taught his people to make bread of it; and so did <i>Eumelus</i>, the
  first King of a region afterwards called <i>Achaia</i>: and therefore
  <i>Arcas</i> and <i>Eumelus</i> were contemporary to <i>Triptolemus</i>,
  and to his old father <i>Celeus</i>, and to <i>Erechtheus</i> King of
  <i>Athens</i>; and <i>Callisto</i> to <i>Rharus</i>, and her father
  <i>Lycaon</i> to <i>Cranaus</i>: but <i>Lycaon</i> died before
  <i>Cranaus</i>, so as to leave room for <i>Deucalion</i>'s flood between
  their deaths. The eleven Kings of <i>Arcadia</i>, between this Flood and
  the Return of the <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i>, that is,
  between the Reigns of <i>Lycaon</i> and <i>Cypselus</i>, after the rate
  of about twenty years to a Reign one with another, took up about 220
  years; and these years counted back from the Return of the
  <i>Heraclides</i>, place the Flood of <i>Deucalion</i> upon the
  fourteenth year of <i>David</i>'s Reign, or thereabout.</p>

  <p><i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_153" href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a>
  tells us, that the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> who came with <i>Cadmus</i>
  brought many doctrines into <i>Greece</i>: for amongst those
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> were a sort of men called <i>Curetes</i>, who were
  skilled in the Arts and Sciences of <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, above other
  men, and <a name="NtA_154" href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> settled
  some in <i>Phrygia</i>, where they were called <i>Corybantes</i>; some in
  <i>Crete</i>, where they were called <i>Idæi Dactyli</i>; some in
  <i>Rhodes</i>, where they were called <i>Telchines</i>; some in
  <i>Samothrace</i>, where they were called <i>Cabiri</i>; some in
  <i>Eub&#339;a</i>, where, before the invention of iron, they wrought in
  copper, in a city thence called <i>Chalcis</i> some in <i>Lemnos</i>,
  where they assisted <i>Vulcan</i>; and some in <i>Imbrus</i>, and other
  places: and a considerable number of them settled in <i>Ætolia</i>, which
  was thence called the country of the <i>Curetes</i>; until <i>Ætolus</i>
  the son of <i>Endymion</i>, having slain <i>Apis</i> King of
  <i>Sicyon</i>, fled thither, and by the assistance of his father invaded
  it, and from his own name called it <i>Ætolia</i>: and by the assistance
  of these artificers, <i>Cadmus</i> found out gold in the mountain
  <i>Pangæus</i> in <i>Thrace</i>, and copper at <i>Thebes</i>; whence
  copper ore is still called <i>Cadmia</i>. Where they settled they wrought
  first in copper, 'till iron was invented, and then in iron; and when they
  had made themselves armour, they danced in it at the sacrifices with
  tumult and clamour, and bells, and pipes, and drums, and swords, with
  which they struck upon one another's armour, in musical times, appearing
  seized with a divine fury; and this is reckoned the original of music in
  <i>Greece:</i> so <i>Solinus</i> <a name="NtA_155"
  href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> <i>Studium musicum inde c&#339;ptum
  cum Idæi Dactyli modulos crepitu &amp; tinnitu æris deprehensos in
  versificum ordinem transtulissent</i>: and <a name="NtA_156"
  href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> <i>Isidorus</i>, <i>Studium musicum
  ab Idæis Dactylis c&#339;ptum</i>. <i>Apollo</i> and the Muses were two
  Generations later. <i>Clemens</i> <a name="NtA_157"
  href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> calls the <i>Idæi Dactyli</i>
  barbarous, that is strangers; and saith, that they reputed the first wise
  men, to whom both the letters which they call <i>Ephesian</i>, and the
  invention of musical rhymes are referred: it seems that when the
  <i>Ph&#339;nician</i> letters, ascribed to <i>Cadmus</i>, were brought
  into <i>Greece</i>, they were at the same time brought into
  <i>Phrygia</i> and <i>Crete</i>, by the <i>Curetes</i>; who settled in
  those countries, and called them <i>Ephesian</i>, from the city
  <i>Ephesus</i>, where they were first taught. The <i>Curetes</i>, by
  their manufacturing copper and iron, and making swords, and armour, and
  edged tools for hewing and carving of wood, brought into <i>Europe</i> a
  new way of fighting; and gave <i>Minos</i> an opportunity of building a
  Fleet, and gaining the dominion of the seas; and set on foot the trades
  of Smiths and Carpenters in <i>Greece</i>, which are the foundation of
  manual trades: the <a name="NtA_158" href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a>
  fleet of <i>Minos</i> was without sails, and <i>Dædalus</i> fled from him
  by adding sails to his vessel; and therefore ships with sails were not
  used by the <i>Greeks</i> before the flight of <i>Dædalus</i>, and death
  of <i>Minos</i>, who was slain in pursuing him to <i>Sicily</i>, in the
  Reign of <i>Rehoboam</i>. <i>Dædalus</i> and his nephew <i>Talus</i>, in
  the latter part of the Reign of <i>Solomon</i>, invented the chip-ax, and
  saw, and wimble, and perpendicular, and compass, and turning-lath, and
  glew, and the potter's wheel; and his father <i>Eupalamus</i> invented
  the anchor: and these things gave a beginning to manual Arts and Trades
  in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

  <p>The <a name="NtA_159" href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a>
  <i>Curetes</i>, who thus introduced Letters, and Music, and Poetry, and
  Dancing, and Arts, and attended on the Sacrifices, were no less active
  about religious institutions, and for their skill and knowledge and
  mystical practices, were accounted wise men and conjurers by the vulgar.
  In <i>Phrygia</i> their mysteries were about <i>Rhea</i>, called <i>Magna
  Mater</i>, and from the places where she was worshipped, <i>Cybele</i>,
  <i>Berecynthia</i>, <i>Pessinuntia</i>, <i>Dindymene</i>,
  <i>Mygdonia</i>, and <i>Idæa Phrygia</i>: and in <i>Crete</i>, and the
  <i>Terra Curetum</i>, they were about <i>Jupiter Olympius</i>, the son of
  the <i>Cretan Rhea</i>: they represented, <a name="NtA_160"
  href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> that when <i>Jupiter</i> was born in
  <i>Crete</i>, his mother <i>Rhea</i> caused him to be educated in a cave
  in mount <i>Ida</i>, under their care and tuition; and <a name="NtA_161"
  href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> that they danced about him in armour,
  with great noise, that his father <i>Saturn</i> might not hear him cry;
  and when he was grown up, assisted him in conquering his father, and his
  father's friends; and in memory of these things instituted their
  mysteries. <i>Bochart</i> <a name="NtA_162"
  href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> brings them from <i>Palestine</i>,
  and thinks that they had the name of <i>Curetes</i> from the people among
  the <i>Philistims</i> called <i>Crethim</i>, or <i>Cerethites</i>:
  <i>Ezek.</i> xxv. 16. <i>Zeph.</i> ii. 5. 1 <i>Sam.</i> xxx. 14, for the
  <i>Philistims</i> conquered <i>Zidon</i>, and mixed with the
  <i>Zidonians</i>.</p>

  <p>The two first Kings of <i>Crete</i>, who reigned after the coming of
  the <i>Curetes</i>, were <i>Asterius</i> and <i>Minos</i>; and
  <i>Europa</i> was the Queen of <i>Asterius</i>, and mother of
  <i>Minos</i>; and the <i>Idæan Curetes</i> were her countrymen, and came
  with her and her brother <i>Alymnus</i> into <i>Crete</i>, and dwelt in
  the <i>Idæan</i> cave in her Reign, and there educated <i>Jupiter</i>,
  and found out iron, and made armour: and therefore these three,
  <i>Asterius</i>, <i>Europa</i>, and <i>Minos</i>, must be the
  <i>Saturn</i>, <i>Rhea</i> and <i>Jupiter</i> of the <i>Cretans</i>.
  <i>Minos</i> is usually called the son of <i>Jupiter</i>; but this is in
  relation to the fable, that <i>Jupiter</i> in the shape of a bull, the
  Ensign of the Ship, carried away <i>Europa</i> from <i>Zidon</i>: for the
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>, upon their first coming into <i>Greece</i>, gave
  the name of <i>Jao-pater</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>, to every King: and thus
  both <i>Minos</i> and his father were <i>Jupiters</i>. <i>Echemenes</i>,
  an ancient author cited by <i>Athenæus</i>, <a name="NtA_163"
  href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> said that <i>Minos</i> was that
  <i>Jupiter</i> who committed the rape upon <i>Ganimede</i>; though others
  said more truly that it was <i>Tantalus</i>: <i>Minos</i> alone was that
  <i>Jupiter</i> who was most famous among the <i>Greeks</i> for Dominion
  and Justice, being the greatest King in all <i>Greece</i> in those days,
  and the only legislator. <i>Plutarch</i> <a name="NtA_164"
  href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> tells us, that the people of
  <i>Naxus</i>, contrary to what others write, pretended that there were
  two <i>Minos's</i>, and two <i>Ariadnes</i>; and that the first
  <i>Ariadne</i> married <i>Bacchus</i>, and the last was carried away by
  <i>Theseus</i>: but <a name="NtA_165" href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a>
  <i>Homer</i>, <i>Hesiod</i>, <i>Thucydides</i>, <i>Herodotus</i>, and
  <i>Strabo</i>, knew but of one <i>Minos</i>; and <i>Homer</i> describes
  him to be the son of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Europa</i>, and the brother of
  <i>Rhadamanthus</i> and <i>Sarpedon</i>, and the father of
  <i>Deucalion</i> the <i>Argonaut</i>, and grandfather of <i>Idomeneus</i>
  who warred at <i>Troy</i>, and that he was the legislator of Hell:
  <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_166" href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a>
  makes <i>Minos</i> and <i>Rhadamanthus</i> the sons of <i>Europa</i>,
  contemporary to <i>Ægeus</i>: and <a name="NtA_167"
  href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> <i>Apollodorus</i> and <i>Hyginus</i>
  say, that <i>Minos</i>, the father of <i>Androgeus</i>, <i>Ariadne</i>
  and <i>Phædra</i>, was the son of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Europa</i>, and
  brother of <i>Rhadamanthus</i> and <i>Sarpedon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Lucian</i> <a name="NtA_168" href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a>
  lets us know that <i>Europa</i> the mother of <i>Minos</i> was worshipped
  by the name of <i>Rhea</i>, the form of a woman sitting in a chariot
  drawn by lions, with a drum in her hand, and a <i>Corona turrita</i> on
  her head, like <i>Astarte</i> and <i>Isis</i>; and the <i>Cretans</i> <a
  name="NtA_169" href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> anciently shewed the
  house where this <i>Rhea</i> lived: and <a name="NtA_170"
  href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> <i>Apollonius Rhodius</i> tells us,
  that <i>Saturn</i>, while he Reigned over the <i>Titans</i> in
  <i>Olympus</i>, a mountain in <i>Crete</i>, and <i>Jupiter</i> was
  educated by the <i>Curetes</i> in the <i>Cretan</i> cave, deceived
  <i>Rhea</i>, and of <i>Philyra</i> begot <i>Chiron</i>: and therefore the
  <i>Cretan Saturn</i> and <i>Rhea</i>, were but one Generation older than
  <i>Chiron</i>, and by consequence not older than <i>Asterius</i> and
  <i>Europa</i>, the parents of <i>Minos</i>; for <i>Chiron</i> lived 'till
  after the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition, and had two grandsons in that
  Expedition, and <i>Europa</i> came into <i>Crete</i> above an hundred
  years before that Expedition: <i>Lucian</i> <a name="NtA_171"
  href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> tells us, that the <i>Cretans</i> did
  not only relate, that <i>Jupiter</i> was born and buried among them, but
  also shewed his sepulchre: and <i>Porphyry</i> <a name="NtA_172"
  href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> tells us, that <i>Pythagoras</i> went
  down into the <i>Idæan</i> cave, to see sepulchre: and <i>Cicero</i>, <a
  name="NtA_173" href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> in numbering three
  <i>Jupiters</i>, saith, that the third was the <i>Cretan Jupiter</i>,
  <i>Saturn</i>'s son, whose sepulchre was shewed in <i>Crete</i>: and the
  Scholiast upon <i>Callimachus</i> <a name="NtA_174"
  href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> lets us know, that this was the
  sepulchre of <i>Minos</i>: his words are, <span lang="el" title="En Krêtê epi tôi taphôi tou Minôos epegegrapto, MINÔOS TOU DIOS TAPHOS. tôi chronôi de tou Minôos apêleiphthê, hôste perileiphthênai, DIOS TAPHOS. ek toutou oun echein legousi Krêtes ton taphon tou Dios."

  understood the <i>Saturn</i> so called by the <i>Latines</i>: for when

  <i>Saturn</i>'s carrying letters into <i>Italy</i>, and coyning money,
  and teaching agriculture, and making instruments, and building a town,
  you may know that he fled from <i>Crete</i>, after letters, and the
  coyning of money, and manual arts were brought into <i>Europe</i> by the
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>; and from <i>Attica</i>, after agriculture was
  brought into <i>Greece</i> by <i>Ceres</i>; and so could not be older
  than <i>Asterius</i>, and <i>Europa</i>, and her brother <i>Cadmus</i>:
  and by <i>Italy</i>'s being called <i>Oenotria</i>, before it was called
  <i>Saturnia</i>, you may know that he came into <i>Italy</i> after
  <i>Oenotrus</i>, and so was not older than the sons of <i>Lycaon</i>.
  <i>Oenotrus</i> carried the first colony of the <i>Greeks</i> into
  <i>Italy</i>, <i>Saturn</i> the second, and <i>Evander</i> the third; and
  the <i>Latines</i> know nothing older in <i>Italy</i> than <i>Janus</i>
  and <i>Saturn</i>: and therefore <i>Oenotrus</i> was the <i>Janus</i> of
  the <i>Latines</i>, and <i>Saturn</i> was contemporary to the sons of
  <i>Lycaon</i>, and by consequence also to <i>Celeus</i>,
  <i>Erechtheus</i>, <i>Ceres</i>, and <i>Asterius</i>: for <i>Ceres</i>
  educated <i>Triptolemus</i> the son of <i>Celeus</i>, in the Reign of
  <i>Erechtheus</i>, and then taught him to plow and sow corn: <i>Arcas</i>
  the son of <i>Callisto</i>, and grandson of <i>Lycaon</i>, received corn
  from <i>Triptolemus</i>, and taught his people to make bread of it; and
  <i>Procris</i>, the daughter of <i>Erechtheus</i>, fled to <i>Minos</i>
  the son of <i>Asterius</i>. In memory of <i>Saturn</i>'s coming into
  <i>Italy</i> by sea, the <i>Latines</i> coined their first money with his
  head on one side, and a ship on the other. <i>Macrobius</i> <a
  name="NtA_177" href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> tells us, that when
  <i>Saturn</i> was dead, <i>Janus</i> erected an Altar to him, with sacred
  rites as to a God, and instituted the <i>Saturnalia</i>, and that humane
  sacrifices were offered to him; 'till <i>Hercules</i> driving the cattle
  of <i>Geryon</i> through <i>Italy</i>, abolished that custom: by the
  human sacrifices you may know that <i>Janus</i> was of the race of
  <i>Lycaon</i>; which character agrees to <i>Oenotrus</i>. <i>Dionysius
  Halicarnassensis</i> tells us further, that <i>Oenotrus</i> having found
  in the western parts of <i>Italy</i> a large region fit for pasturage and
  tillage, but yet for the most part uninhabited, and where it was
  inhabited, peopled but thinly; in a certain part of it, purged from the
  <i>Barbarians</i>, he built towns little and numerous, in the mountains;
  which manner of building was familiar to the ancients: and this was the
  Original of Towns in <i>Italy</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Pausanias</i> <a name="NtA_178" href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a>
  tells us that <i>the people of </i>Elis<i>, who were best skilled in
  Antiquities, related this to have been the Original of the Olympic Games:
  that </i>Saturn<i> Reigned first and had a Temple built to him in
  </i>Olympia<i> by the men of the Golden Age; and that when </i>Jupiter<i>
  was newly born, his mother </i>Rhea<i> recommended him to the care of the
  </i>Idæi Dactyli<i>, who were also called </i>Curetes<i>: that afterwards
  five of them, called </i>Hercules<i>, </i>P&#339;onius<i>,
  </i>Epimedes<i>, </i>Jasius<i>, and </i>Ida<i>, came from </i>Ida<i>, a
  mountain in </i>Crete<i>, into </i>Elis<i>; and </i>Hercules<i>, called
  also </i>Hercules Idæus<i>, being the oldest of them, in memory of the
  war between </i>Saturn<i> and </i>Jupiter<i>, instituted the game of
  racing, and that the victor should be rewarded with a crown of olive</i>;
  and there erected an altar to <i>Jupiter Olympius</i>, and called these
  games Olympic: and that some of the <i>Eleans</i> said, <i>that
  </i>Jupiter<i> contended here with </i>Saturn<i> for the Kingdom; others
  that </i>Hercules Idæus<i> instituted these games in memory of their
  victory over the </i>Titans: for the people of <i>Arcadia</i> <a
  name="NtA_179" href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> had a tradition, that
  the Giants fought with the Gods in the valley of <i>Bathos</i>, near the
  river <i>Alpheus</i> and the fountain <i>Olympias</i>. <a name="NtA_180"
  href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> Before the Reign of <i>Asterius</i>,
  his father <i>Teutamus</i> came into <i>Crete</i> with a colony from
  <i>Olympia</i>; and upon the flight of <i>Asterius</i>, some of his
  friends might retire with him into their own country, and be pursued and
  beaten there by the <i>Idæan Hercules</i>: the <i>Eleans</i> said also
  that <i>Clymenus</i> the grandson of the <i>Idæan Hercules</i>, about
  fifty years after <i>Deucalion</i>'s flood, coming from <i>Crete</i>,
  celebrated these games again in <i>Olympia</i>, and erected there an
  altar to <i>Juno Olympia</i>, that is, to <i>Europa</i>, and another to
  this <i>Hercules</i> and the rest of the <i>Curetes</i>; and Reigned in
  <i>Elis</i> 'till he was expelled by <i>Endymion</i>, <a name="NtA_181"
  href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> who thereupon celebrated these games
  again: and so did <i>Pelops</i>, who expelled <i>Ætolus</i> the son of
  <i>Endymion</i>; and so also did <i>Hercules</i> the son of
  <i>Alcmena</i>, and <i>Atreus</i> the son of <i>Pelops</i>, and
  <i>Oxylus</i>: they might be celebrated originally in triumph for
  victories, first by <i>Hercules Idæus</i>, upon the conquest of
  <i>Saturn</i> and the <i>Titans</i>, and then by <i>Clymenus</i>, upon
  his coming to Reign in the <i>Terra Curetum</i>; then by <i>Endymion</i>,
  upon his conquering <i>Clymenus</i>; and afterwards by <i>Pelops</i>,
  upon his conquering <i>Ætolus</i>; and by <i>Hercules</i>, upon his
  killing <i>Augeas</i>; and by <i>Atreus</i>, upon his repelling the
  <i>Heraclides</i>; and by <i>Oxylus</i>, upon the return of the
  <i>Heraclides</i> into <i>Peloponnesus</i>. This <i>Jupiter</i>, to whom
  they were instituted, had a Temple and Altar erected to him in
  <i>Olympia</i>, where the games were celebrated, and from the place was
  called <i>Jupiter Olympius</i>: <i>Olympia</i> was a place upon the
  confines of <i>Pisa</i>, near the river <i>Alpheus</i>.</p>

  <p>In the <a name="NtA_182" href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> Island
  <i>Thasus</i>, where <i>Cadmus</i> left his brother <i>Thasus</i>, the
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> built a Temple to <i>Hercules Olympius</i>, that
  <i>Hercules</i>, whom <i>Cicero</i> <a name="NtA_183"
  href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> calls <i>ex Idæis Dactylis; cui
  inferias afferunt</i>. When the mysteries of <i>Ceres</i> were instituted
  in <i>Eleusis</i>, there were other mysteries instituted to her and her
  daughter and daughter's husband, in the Island <i>Samothrace</i>, by the
  <i>Ph&#339;nician</i> names of <i>Dii Cabiri Axieros</i>,
  <i>Axiokersa</i>, and <i>Axiokerses</i>, that is, the great Gods
  <i>Ceres</i>, <i>Proserpina</i> and <i>Pluto</i>: for <a name="NtA_184"
  href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> <i>Jasius</i> a <i>Samothracian</i>,
  whose sister married <i>Cadmus</i>, was familiar with <i>Ceres</i>; and
  <i>Cadmus</i> and <i>Jasius</i> were both of them instituted in these
  mysteries. <i>Jasius</i> was the brother of <i>Dardanus</i>, and married
  <i>Cybele</i> the daughter of <i>Meones</i> King of <i>Phrygia</i>, and
  by her had <i>Corybas</i>; and after his death, <i>Dardanus</i>,
  <i>Cybele</i> and <i>Corybas</i> went into <i>Phrygia</i>, and carried
  thither the mysteries of the mother of the Gods, and <i>Cybele</i> called
  the goddess after her own name, and <i>Corybas</i> called her priests
  <i>Corybantes</i>: thus <i>Diodorus</i>; but <i>Dionysius</i> saith <a
  name="NtA_185" href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> that <i>Dardanus</i>
  instituted the <i>Samothracian</i> mysteries, and that his wife
  <i>Chryses</i> learnt them in <i>Arcadia</i>, and that <i>Idæus</i> the
  son of <i>Dardanus</i> instituted afterwards the mysteries of the mother
  of the gods in <i>Phrygia</i>: this <i>Phrygian</i> Goddess was drawn in
  a chariot by lions, and had a <i>corona turrita</i> on her head, and a
  drum in her hand, like the <i>Ph&#339;nician</i> Goddess <i>Astarte</i>,
  and the <i>Corybantes</i> danced in armour at her sacrifices in a furious
  manner, like the <i>Idæi Dactyli</i>; and <i>Lucian</i> <a name="NtA_186"
  href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> tells us that she was the <i>Cretan
  Rhea</i>, that is, <i>Europa</i> the mother of <i>Minos</i>: and thus the
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> introduced the practice of Deifying dead men and
  women among the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Phrygians</i>; for I meet with no
  instance of Deifying dead men and women in <i>Greece</i>, before the
  coming of <i>Cadmus</i> and <i>Europa</i> from <i>Zidon</i>.</p>

  <p>From these originals it came into fashion among the <i>Greeks</i>,

  <i>parentare</i>, to celebrate the funerals of dead parents with
  festivals and invocations and sacrifices offered to their ghosts, and to
  erect magnificent sepulchres in the form of temples, with altars and
  statues, to persons of renown; and there to honour them publickly with
  sacrifices and invocations: every man might do it to his ancestors; and
  the cities of <i>Greece</i> did it to all the eminent <i>Greeks</i>: as
  to <i>Europa</i> the sister, to <i>Alymnus</i> the brother, and to
  <i>Minos</i> and <i>Rhadamanthus</i> the nephews of <i>Cadmus</i>; to his
  daughter <i>Ino</i>, and her son <i>Melicertus</i>; to <i>Bacchus</i> the
  son of his daughter <i>Semele</i>, <i>Aristarchus</i> the husband of his
  daughter <i>Autonoe</i>, and <i>Jasius</i> the brother of his wife
  <i>Harmonia</i>; to <i>Hercules</i> a <i>Theban</i>, and his mother
  <i>Alcmena</i>; to <i>Danae</i> the daughter of <i>Acrisius</i>; to
  <i>Æsculapius</i> and <i>Polemocrates</i> the son of <i>Machaon</i>, to
  <i>Pandion</i> and <i>Theseus</i> Kings of <i>Athens</i>,
  <i>Hippolytus</i> the son of <i>Theseus</i>, <i>Pan</i> the son of
  <i>Penelope</i>, <i>Proserpina</i>, <i>Triptolemus</i>, <i>Celeus</i>,
  <i>Trophonius</i>, <i>Castor</i>, <i>Pollux</i>, <i>Helena</i>,
  <i>Menelaus</i>, <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Amphiaraus</i> and his son
  <i>Amphilochus</i>, <i>Hector</i> and <i>Alexandra</i> the son and
  daughter of <i>Priam</i>, <i>Phoroneus</i>, <i>Orpheus</i>,
  <i>Protesilaus</i>, <i>Achilles</i> and his mother <i>Thetis</i>,
  <i>Ajax</i>, <i>Arcas</i>, <i>Idomeneus</i>, <i>Meriones</i>,
  <i>Æacus</i>, <i>Melampus</i>, <i>Britomartis</i>, <i>Adrastus</i>,
  <i>Iolaus</i>, and divers others. They Deified their dead in divers
  manners, according to their abilities and circumstances, and the merits
  of the person; some only in private families, as houshold Gods or <i>Dii
  Pænates</i>; others by erecting gravestones to them in publick, to be
  used as altars for annual sacrifices; others, by building also to them
  sepulchres in the form of houses or temples; and some by appointing
  mysteries, and ceremonies, and set sacrifices, and festivals, and
  initiations, and a succession of priests for performing those
  institutions in the temples, and handing them down to posterity. Altars
  might begin to be erected in <i>Europe</i> a little before the days of
  <i>Cadmus</i>, for sacrificing to the old God or Gods of the Colonies,
  but Temples began in the days of <i>Solomon</i>; for <a name="NtA_187"
  href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> <i>Æacus</i> the son of <i>Ægina</i>,
  who was two Generations older than the <i>Trojan</i> war, is by some
  reputed one of the first who built a Temple in <i>Greece</i>. Oracles
  came first from <i>Egypt</i> into <i>Greece</i> about the same time, as
  also did the custom of forming the images of the Gods with their legs
  bound up in the shape of the <i>Egyptian</i> mummies: for Idolatry began
  in <i>Chaldæa</i> and <i>Egypt</i>, and spread thence into
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and the neighbouring countries, long before it came
  into <i>Europe</i>; and the <i>Pelasgians</i> propagated it in
  <i>Greece</i>, by the dictates of the Oracles. The countries upon the
  <i>Tigris</i> and the <i>Nile</i> being exceeding fertile, were first
  frequented by mankind, and grew first into Kingdoms, and therefore began
  first to adore their dead Kings and Queens: hence came the Gods of
  <i>Laban</i>, the Gods and Goddesses called <i>Baalim</i> and
  <i>Ashtaroth</i> by the <i>Canaanites</i>, the Dæmons or Ghosts to whom
  they sacrificed, and the <i>Moloch</i> to whom they offered their
  children in the days of <i>Moses</i> and the Judges. Every City set up
  the worship of its own Founder and Kings, and by alliances and conquests
  they spread this worship, and at length the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> and
  <i>Egyptians</i> brought into <i>Europe</i> the practice of Deifying the
  dead. The Kingdom of the lower <i>Egypt</i> began to worship their Kings
  before the days of <i>Moses</i>; and to this worship the second
  commandment is opposed: when the Shepherds invaded the lower
  <i>Egypt</i>, they checked this worship of the old <i>Egyptians</i>, and
  spread that of their own Kings: and at length the <i>Egyptians</i> of
  <i>Coptos</i> and <i>Thebais</i>, under <i>Misphragmuthosis</i> and
  <i>Amosis</i>, expelling the Shepherds, checked the worship of the Gods
  of the Shepherds, and Deifying their own Kings and Princes, propagated
  the worship of twelve of them into their conquests; and made them more
  universal than the false Gods of any other nation had been before, so as
  to be called, <i>Dii magni majorum gentium</i>. <i>Sesostris</i>
  conquered <i>Thrace</i>, and <i>Amphictyon</i> the son of
  <i>Prometheus</i> brought the twelve Gods from <i>Thrace</i> into
  <i>Greece</i>: <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_188"
  href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> tells us that they came from
  <i>Egypt</i>; and by the names of the cities of <i>Egypt</i> dedicated to
  many of these Gods, you may know that they were of an <i>Egyptian</i>
  original: and the <i>Egyptians</i>, according to <i>Diodorus</i>, <a
  name="NtA_189" href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> usually represented,
  that after their <i>Saturn</i> and <i>Rhea</i>, Reigned <i>Jupiter</i>
  and <i>Juno</i>, the parents of <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i>, the
  parents of <i>Orus</i> and <i>Bubaste</i>.</p>

  <p>By all this it may be understood, that as the <i>Egyptians</i> who
  Deified their Kings, began their monarchy with the Reign of their Gods
  and Heroes, reckoning <i>Menes</i> the first man who reigned after their
  Gods; so the <i>Cretans</i> had the Ages of their Gods and Heroes,
  calling the first four Ages of their Deified Kings and Princes, the
  Golden, Silver, Brazen, and Iron Ages. <i>Hesiod</i> <a name="NtA_190"
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> describing these four Ages of the
  Gods and Demi-Gods of <i>Greece</i>, represents them to be four
  Generations of men, each of which ended when the men then living grew old
  and dropt into the grave, and tells us that the fourth ended with the
  wars of <i>Thebes</i> and <i>Troy</i>: and so many Generations there
  were, from the coming of the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> and <i>Curetes</i>
  with <i>Cadmus</i> and <i>Europa</i> into <i>Greece</i> unto the
  destruction of <i>Troy</i>. <i>Apollonius Rhodius</i> saith that when the
  <i>Argonauts</i> came to <i>Crete</i>, they slew <i>Talus</i> a brazen
  man, who remained of those that were of the Brazen Age, and guarded that
  pass: <i>Talus</i> was reputed <a name="NtA_191"
  href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> the son of <i>Minos</i>, and
  therefore the sons of <i>Minos</i> lived in the Brazen Age, and
  <i>Minos</i> Reigned in the Silver Age: it was the Silver Age of the
  <i>Greeks</i> in which they began to plow and sow Corn, and <i>Ceres</i>,
  that taught them to do it, flourished in the Reign of <i>Celeus</i> and
  <i>Erechtheus</i> and <i>Minos</i>. Mythologists tell us that the last
  woman with whom <i>Jupiter</i> lay, was <i>Alcmena</i>; and thereby they
  seem to put an end to the Reign of <i>Jupiter</i> among mortals, that is
  to the Silver Age, when <i>Alcmena</i> was with child of <i>Hercules</i>;
  who therefore was born about the eighth or tenth year of
  <i>Rehoboam's</i> Reign, and was about 34 years old at the time of the
  <i>Argonautic</i> expedition. <i>Chiron</i> was begot by <i>Saturn</i> of
  <i>Philyra</i> in the Golden Age, when <i>Jupiter</i> was a child in the
  <i>Cretan</i> cave, as above; and this was in the Reign of
  <i>Asterius</i> King of <i>Crete</i>: and therefore <i>Asterius</i>
  Reigned in <i>Crete</i> in the Golden Age; and the Silver Age began when
  <i>Chiron</i> was a child: if <i>Chiron</i> was born about the 35th year
  of <i>David</i>'s Reign, he will be born in the Reign of <i>Asterius</i>,
  when <i>Jupiter</i> was a child in the <i>Cretan</i> cave, and be about
  88 years old in the time of the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition, when he
  invented the Asterisms; and this is within the reach of nature. The
  Golden Age therefore falls in with the Reign of <i>Asterius</i>, and the
  Silver Age with that of <i>Minos</i>; and to make these Ages much longer
  than ordinary generations, is to make <i>Chiron</i> live much longer than
  according to the course of nature. This fable of the four Ages seems to
  have been made by the <i>Curetes</i> in the fourth Age, in memory of the
  first four Ages of their coming into <i>Europe</i>, as into a new world;
  and in honour of their country-woman <i>Europa</i>, and her husband
  <i>Asterius</i> the <i>Saturn</i> of the <i>Latines</i>, and of her son
  <i>Minos</i> the <i>Cretan Jupiter</i> and grandson <i>Deucalion</i>, who
  Reigned 'till the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition, and is sometimes reckoned
  among the <i>Argonauts</i>, and of their great grandson <i>Idomeneus</i>
  who warred at <i>Troy</i>. <i>Hesiod</i> tells us that he himself lived
  in the fifth Age, the Age next after the taking of <i>Troy</i>, and
  therefore he flourished within thirty or thirty five years after it: and
  <i>Homer</i> was of about the same Age; for he <a name="NtA_192"
  href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> lived sometime with <i>Mentor</i> in
  <i>Ithaca</i>, and there learnt of him many things concerning
  <i>Ulysses</i>, with whom <i>Mentor</i> had been personally acquainted:
  now <i>Herodotus</i>, the oldest Historian of the <i>Greeks</i> now
  extant, <a name="NtA_193" href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> tells us
  that <i>Hesiod</i> and <i>Homer</i> were not above four hundred years
  older than himself, and therefore they flourished within 110 or 120 years
  after the death of <i>Solomon</i>; and according to my reckoning the
  taking of <i>Troy</i> was but one Generation earlier.</p>

  <p>Mythologists tell us, that <i>Niobe</i> the daughter of
  <i>Phoroneus</i> was the first woman with whom <i>Jupiter</i> lay, and
  that of her he begat <i>Argus</i>, who succeeded <i>Phoroneus</i> in the
  Kingdom of <i>Argos</i>, and gave his name to that city; and therefore
  <i>Argus</i> was born in the beginning of the Silver Age: unless you had
  rather say that by <i>Jupiter</i> they might here mean <i>Asterius</i>;
  for the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> gave the name of <i>Jupiter</i> to every
  King, from the time of their first coming into <i>Greece</i> with
  <i>Cadmus</i> and <i>Europa</i>, until the invasion of <i>Greece</i> by
  <i>Sesostris</i>, and the birth of <i>Hercules</i>, and particularly to
  the fathers of <i>Minos</i>, <i>Pelops</i>, <i>Lacedæmon</i>,
  <i>Æacus</i>, and <i>Perseus</i>.</p>

  <p>The four first Ages succeeded the flood of <i>Deucalion</i>; and some
  tell us that <i>Deucalion</i> was the son of <i>Prometheus</i>, the son
  of <i>Japetus</i>, and brother of <i>Atlas</i>: but this was another
  <i>Deucalion</i>; for <i>Japetus</i> the father of <i>Prometheus</i>,
  <i>Epimetheus,</i> and <i>Atlas</i>, was an <i>Egyptian</i>, the brother
  of <i>Osiris</i>, and flourished two generations after the flood of
  <i>Deucalion</i>.</p>

  <p>I have now carried up the Chronology of the <i>Greeks</i> as high as
  to the first use of letters, the first plowing and sowing of corn, the
  first manufacturing of copper and iron, the beginning of the trades of
  Smiths, Carpenters, Joyners, Turners, Brick-makers, Stone-cutters, and
  Potters, in <i>Europe</i>; the first walling of cities about, the first
  building of Temples, and the original of Oracles in <i>Greece</i>; the
  beginning of navigation by the Stars in long ships with sails; the
  erecting of the <i>Amphictyonic</i> Council; the first Ages of
  <i>Greece</i>, called the Golden, Silver, Brazen and Iron Ages, and the
  flood of <i>Deucalion</i> which immediately preceded them. Those Ages
  could not be earlier than the invention and use of the four metals in
  <i>Greece</i>, from whence they had their names; and the flood of
  <i>Ogyges</i> could not be much above two or three ages earlier than that
  of <i>Deucalion</i>: for among such wandering people as were then in
  <i>Europe</i>, there could be no memory of things done above three or
  four ages before the first use of letters: and the expulsion of the
  Shepherds out of <i>Egypt</i>, which gave the first occasion to the
  coming of people from <i>Egypt</i> into <i>Greece</i>, and to the
  building of houses and villages in <i>Greece</i>, was scarce earlier than
  the days of <i>Eli</i> and <i>Samuel</i>; for <i>Manetho</i> tells us,
  that when they were forced to quit <i>Abaris</i> and retire out of
  <i>Egypt</i>, they went through the wilderness into <i>Judæa</i> and
  built <i>Jerusalem</i>: I do not think, with <i>Manetho,</i> that they
  were the <i>Israelites</i> under <i>Moses</i>, but rather believe that
  they were <i>Canaanites</i>; and upon leaving <i>Abaris</i> mingled with
  the <i>Philistims</i> their next neighbours: though some of them might
  assist <i>David</i> and <i>Solomon</i> in building <i>Jerusalem</i> and
  the Temple.</p>

  <p><i>Saul</i> was made King <a name="NtA_194"
  href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a>, that he might rescue <i>Israel</i>
  out of the hand of the <i>Philistims</i>, who opressed them; and in the
  second year of his Reign, the <i>Philistims</i> brought into the field
  against him <i>thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and
  people as the sand which is on the sea shore for multitude</i>: the
  <i>Canaanites</i> had their horses from <i>Egypt</i>; and yet in the days
  of <i>Moses</i> all the chariots of <i>Egypt</i>, with which
  <i>Pharaoh</i> pursued <i>Israel</i> were but six hundred, <i>Exod.</i>
  xiv. 7. From the great army of the <i>Philistims</i> against <i>Saul</i>,
  and the great number of their horses, I seem to gather that the Shepherds
  had newly relinquished <i>Egypt</i>; and joyned them: the Shepherds might
  be beaten and driven out of the greatest part of <i>Egypt</i>, and shut
  up in <i>Abaris</i> by <i>Misphragmuthosis</i> in the latter end of the
  days of <i>Eli</i>; and some of them fly to the <i>Philistims</i>, and
  strengthen them against <i>Israel</i>, in the last year of <i>Eli</i>;
  and from the <i>Philistims</i> some of the Shepherds might go to
  <i>Zidon</i>, and from <i>Zidon</i>, by sea to <i>Asia minor</i> and
  <i>Greece</i>: and afterwards, in the beginning of the Reign of
  <i>Saul</i>, the Shepherds who still remained in <i>Egypt</i> might be
  forced by <i>Tethmosis</i> or <i>Amosis</i> the son of
  <i>Misphragmuthosis</i>, to leave <i>Abaris</i>, and retire in very great
  numbers to the <i>Philistims</i>; and upon these occasions several of
  them, as <i>Pelasgus</i>, <i>Inachus</i>, <i>Lelex</i>, <i>Cecrops</i>,
  and <i>Abas</i>, might come with their people by sea from <i>Egypt</i> to
  <i>Zidon</i> and <i>Cyprus</i>, and thence to <i>Asia minor</i> and
  <i>Greece</i>, in the days of <i>Eli</i>, <i>Samuel</i> and <i>Saul</i>,
  and thereby begin to open a commerce by sea between <i>Zidon</i> and
  <i>Greece</i>, before the revolt of <i>Edom</i> from <i>Judæa</i>, and
  the final coming of the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> from the <i>Red
  Sea</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Pelasgus</i> Reigned in <i>Arcadia</i>, and was the father of
  <i>Lycaon</i>, according to <i>Pherecydes Atheniensis</i>, and
  <i>Lycaon</i> died just before the flood of <i>Deucalion</i>; and
  therefore his father <i>Pelasgus</i> might come into <i>Greece</i> about
  two Generations before <i>Cadmus</i>, or in the latter end of the days of
  <i>Eli</i>: <i>Lycaon</i> sacrificed children, and therefore his father
  might come with his people from the Shepherds in <i>Egypt</i>, and
  perhaps from the regions of <i>Heliopolis</i>, where they sacrificed men,
  'till <i>Amosis</i> abolished that custom. <i>Misphragmuthosis</i> the
  father of <i>Amosis</i>, drove the Shepherds out of a great part of
  <i>Egypt</i>, and shut the remainder up in <i>Abaris</i>: and then great
  numbers might escape to <i>Greece</i>; some from the regions of
  <i>Heliopolis</i> under <i>Pelasgus</i>, and others from <i>Memphis</i>
  and other places, under other Captains: and hence it might come to pass
  that the <i>Pelasgians</i> were at the first very numerous in
  <i>Greece</i>, and spake a different language from the <i>Greek</i>, and
  were the ringleaders in bringing into <i>Greece</i> the worship of the
  dead.</p>

  <p><i>Inachus</i> is called the son of <i>Oceanus</i>, perhaps because he
  came to <i>Greece</i> by sea: he might come with his people to
  <i>Argos</i> from <i>Egypt</i> in the days of <i>Eli</i>, and seat
  himself upon the river <i>Inachus</i>, so named from him, and leave his
  territories to his sons <i>Phoroneus</i>, <i>Ægialeus</i>, and
  <i>Phegeus</i>, in the days of <i>Samuel</i>: for <i>Car</i> the son of
  <i>Phoroneus</i> built a Temple to <i>Ceres</i> in <i>Megara</i>, and
  therefore was contemporary to <i>Erechtheus</i>. <i>Phoroneus</i> Reigned
  at <i>Argos</i>, and <i>Aegialeus</i> at <i>Sicyon</i>, and founded those
  Kingdoms; and yet <i>Ægialeus</i> is made above five hundred years older
  than <i>Phoroneus</i> by some Chronologers: but <a name="NtA_195"
  href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> <i>Acusilaus</i>, <a name="NtA_196"
  href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> <i>Anticlides</i> and <a
  name="NtA_197" href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> <i>Plato</i>,
  accounted <i>Phoroneus</i> the oldest King in <i>Greece</i>, and <a
  name="NtA_198" href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> <i>Apollodorus</i>
  tells us, <i>Ægialeus</i> was the brother of <i>Phoroneus</i>.
  <i>Ægialeus</i> died without issue, and after him Reigned <i>Europs</i>,
  <i>Telchin</i>, <i>Apis</i>, <i>Lamedon</i>, <i>Sicyon</i>,
  <i>Polybus</i>, <i>Adrastus</i>, and <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> and
  <i>Sicyon</i> gave his name to the Kingdom: <i>Herodotus</i> <a
  name="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> saith that <i>Apis</i>
  in the <i>Greek</i> Tongue is <i>Epaphus</i>; and <i>Hyginus</i>, <a
  name="NtA_200" href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> that <i>Epaphus</i>
  the <i>Sicyonian</i> got <i>Antiopa</i> with child: but the later
  <i>Greeks</i> have made two men of the two names <i>Apis</i> and
  <i>Epaphus</i> or <i>Epopeus</i>, and between them inserted twelve
  feigned Kings of <i>Sicyon</i>, who made no wars, nor did any thing
  memorable, and yet Reigned five hundred and twenty years, which is, one
  with another, above forty and three years a-piece. If these feigned Kings
  be rejected, and the two Kings <i>Apis</i> and <i>Epopeus</i> be
  reunited; <i>Ægialeus</i> will become contemporary to his brother
  <i>Phoroneus</i>, as he ought to be; for <i>Apis</i> or <i>Epopeus</i>,
  and <i>Nycteus</i> the guardian of <i>Labdacus</i>, were slain in battle
  about the tenth year of <i>Solomon</i>, as above; and the first four
  Kings of <i>Sicyon</i>, <i>Ægialeus</i>, <i>Europs</i>, <i>Telchin</i>,
  <i>Apis</i>, after the rate of about twenty years to a Reign, take up
  about eighty years; and these years counted upwards from the tenth year
  of <i>Solomon</i>, place the beginning of the Reign of <i>Ægialeus</i>
  upon the twelfth year of <i>Samuel</i>, or thereabout: and about that
  time began the Reign of <i>Phoroneus</i> at <i>Argos</i>;
  <i>Apollodorus</i> <a name="NtA_201" href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a>
  calls <i>Adrastus</i> King of <i>Argos</i>; but <i>Homer</i> <a
  name="NtA_202" href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> tells us, that he
  Reigned first at <i>Sicyon</i>: he was in the first war against
  <i>Thebes</i>. Some place <i>Janiscus</i> and <i>Phæstus</i> between
  <i>Polybus</i> and <i>Adrastus</i>, but without any certainty.</p>

  <p><i>Lelex</i> might come with his people into <i>Laconia</i> in the
  days of <i>Eli</i>, and leave his territories to his sons <i>Myles</i>,
  <i>Eurotas</i>, <i>Cleson</i>, and <i>Polycaon</i> in the days of
  <i>Samuel</i>. <i>Myles</i> set up a quern, or handmill to grind corn,
  and is reputed the first among the <i>Greeks</i> who did so: but he
  flourished before <i>Triptolemus</i>, and seems to have had his corn and
  artificers from <i>Egypt</i>. <i>Eurotas</i> the brother, or as some say
  the son of <i>Myles</i>, built <i>Sparta</i>, and called it after the
  name of his daughter <i>Sparta</i>, the wife of <i>Lacedæmon</i>, and
  mother of <i>Eurydice</i>. <i>Cleson</i> was the father of <i>Pylas</i>
  the father of <i>Sciron</i>, who married the daughter of <i>Pandion</i>
  the son of <i>Erechtheus</i>, and contended with <i>Nisus</i> the son of
  <i>Pandion</i> and brother of <i>Ægeus</i>, for the Kingdom; and
  <i>Æacus</i> adjudged it to <i>Nisus</i>. <i>Polycaon</i> invaded
  <i>Messene</i>, then peopled only by villages, called it <i>Messene</i>
  after the name of his wife, and built cities therein.</p>

  <p><i>Cecrops</i> came from <i>Sais</i> in <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Cyprus</i>,
  and thence into <i>Attica</i>: and he might do this in the days of
  <i>Samuel</i>, and marry <i>Agraule</i> the daughter of <i>Actæus</i>,
  and succeed him in <i>Attica</i> soon after, and leave his Kingdom to
  <i>Cranaus</i> in the Reign of <i>Saul</i>, or in the beginning of the
  Reign of <i>David</i>: for the flood of <i>Deucalion</i> happened in the
  Reign of <i>Cranaus</i>.</p>

  <p>Of about the same age with <i>Pelasgus</i>, <i>Inachus</i>,
  <i>Lelex</i>, and <i>Actæus</i>, was <i>Ogyges</i>: he Reigned in
  <i>B&#339;otia</i>, and some of his people were <i>Leleges</i>: and
  either he or his son <i>Eleusis</i> built the city <i>Eleusis</i> in
  <i>Attica</i>, that is, they built a few houses of clay, which in time
  grew into a city. <i>Acusilaus</i> wrote that <i>Phoroneus</i> was older
  than <i>Ogyges</i>, and that <i>Ogyges</i> flourished 1020 years before
  the first Olympiad, as above; but <i>Acusilaus</i> was an <i>Argive</i>,
  and feigned these things in honour of his country: to call things
  <i>Ogygian</i> has been a phrase among the ancient <i>Greeks</i>, to
  signify that they are as old as the first memory of things; and so high
  we have now carried up the Chronology of the <i>Greeks</i>.
  <i>Inachus</i> might be as old as <i>Ogyges</i>, but <i>Acusilaus</i> and
  his followers made them seven hundred years older than the truth; and
  Chronologers, to make out this reckoning, have lengthened the races of
  the Kings of <i>Argos</i> and <i>Sicyon</i>, and changed several
  contemporary Princes of <i>Argos</i> into successive Kings, and inserted
  many feigned Kings into the race of the Kings of <i>Sicyon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Inachus</i> had several sons, who Reigned in several parts of
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>, and there built Towns; as <i>Phoroneus</i>, who
  built <i>Phoronicum</i>, afterwards called <i>Argos</i>, from
  <i>Argus</i> his grandson; <i>Ægialeus</i>, who built <i>Ægialea</i>,
  afterwards called <i>Sicyon</i>, from <i>Sicyon</i> the grandson of
  <i>Erechtheus</i>; <i>Phegeus</i>, who built <i>Phegea</i>, afterwards
  called <i>Psophis</i>, from <i>Psophis</i> the daughter of <i>Lycaon</i>:
  and these were the oldest towns in <i>Peloponnesus</i> then
  <i>Sisyphus</i>, the son of <i>Æolus</i> and grandson of <i>Hellen</i>,
  built <i>Ephyra</i>, afterwards called <i>Corinth</i>; and
  <i>Aëthlius</i>, the son of <i>Æolus</i>, built <i>Elis</i>: and before
  them <i>Cecrops</i> built <i>Cecropia</i>, the cittadel of <i>Athens</i>;
  and <i>Lycaon</i> built <i>Lycosura</i>, reckoned by some the oldest town
  in <i>Arcadia</i>; and his sons, who were at least four and twenty in
  number, built each of them a town; except the youngest, called
  <i>Oenotrus</i>, who grew up after his father's death, and sailed into
  <i>Italy</i> with his people, and there set on foot the building of
  towns, and became the <i>Janus</i> of the <i>Latines</i>.
  <i>Phoroneus</i> had also several children and grand-children, who
  Reigned in several places, and built new towns, as <i>Car</i>,
  <i>Apis</i>, &amp;c. and <i>Hæmon</i>, the son of <i>Pelasgus</i>,
  Reigned in <i>Hæmonia</i>, afterwards called <i>Thessaly</i>, and built
  towns there. This division and subdivision has made great confusion in
  the history of the first Kingdoms of <i>Peloponnesus</i>, and thereby
  given occasion to the vain-glorious <i>Greeks</i>, to make those kingdoms
  much older than they really were: but by all the reckonings
  abovementioned, the first civilizing of the <i>Greeks</i>, and teaching
  them to dwell in houses and towns, and the oldest towns in <i>Europe</i>,
  could scarce be above two or three Generations older than the coming of
  <i>Cadmus</i> from <i>Zidon</i> into <i>Greece</i>; and might most
  probably be occasioned by the expulsion of the Shepherds out of
  <i>Egypt</i> in the days of <i>Eli</i> and <i>Samuel</i>, and their
  flying into <i>Greece</i> in considerable numbers: but it's difficult to
  set right the Genealogies and Chronology of the Fabulous Ages of the
  <i>Greeks</i>, and I leave these things to be further examined.</p>

  <p>Before the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> introduced the Deifying of dead men,
  the <i>Greeks</i> had a Council of Elders in every town for the
  government thereof, and a place where the elders and people worshipped
  their God with Sacrifices: and when many of those towns, for their common
  safety, united under a common Council, they erected a <i>Prytaneum</i> or
  Court in one of the towns, where the Council and People met at certain
  times, to consult their common safety, and worship their common God with
  sacrifices, and to buy and sell: the towns where these Councils met, the
  <i>Greeks</i> called <span lang="el" title="dêmoi"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, peoples or communities, or
  Corporation Towns: and at length, when many of these <span lang="el"
  title="dêmoi" >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span> for their
  common safety united by consent under one common Council, they erected a
  <i>Prytaneum</i> in one of the <span lang="el" title="dêmoi"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span> for the common Council and
  People to meet in, and to consult and worship in, and feast, and buy, and
  sell; and this <span lang="el" title="dêmos"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> they walled about for its
  safety, and called <span lang="el" title="tên polin"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3BD; &#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span> the
  city: and this I take to have been the original of Villages,
  Market-Towns, Cities, common Councils, Vestal Temples, Feasts and Fairs,
  in <i>Europe</i>: the <i>Prytaneum</i>, <span lang="el" title="pyros tameion"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>, was a Court
  with a place of worship, and a perpetual fire kept therein upon an Altar
  for sacrificing: from the word <span lang="el" title="Hestia"
  >&#x201B;&#x395;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> fire, came the name
  <i>Vesta</i>, which at length the people turned into a Goddess, and so
  became fire-worshippers like the ancient <i>Persians</i>: and when these
  Councils made war upon their neighbours, they had a general commander to
  lead their armies, and he became their King.</p>

  <p>So <i>Thucydides</i> <a name="NtA_203"
  href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> tells us, that <i>under</i> Cecrops
  <i>and the ancient Kings, untill </i>Theseus<i>; </i>Attica<i> was always
  inhabited city by city, each having Magistrates and </i>Prytanea<i>:
  neither did they consult the King, when there was no fear of danger, but
  each apart administred their own common-wealth, and had their own
  Council, and even sometimes made war, as the </i>Eleusinians<i> with
  </i>Eumolpus<i> did against </i>Erechtheus<i>: but when </i>Theseus<i>, a
  prudent and potent man obtained the Kingdom, he took away the Courts and
  Magistrates of the other cities, and made them all meet in one Council
  and </i>Prytaneum<i> at </i>Athens. <i>Polemon</i>, as he is cited by <a
  name="NtA_204" href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> <i>Strabo</i>, tells
  us, <i>that in this body of </i>Attica<i>, there were 170 </i><span
  lang="el" title="dêmoi" >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span><i>,
  one of which was </i>Eleusis: and <i>Philochorus</i> <a name="NtA_205"
  href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> relates, that <i>when </i>Attica<i>
  was infested by sea and land by the </i>Cares<i> and </i>B&#339;oti<i>,
  </i>Cecrops<i> the first of any man reduced the multitude, </i>that is
  the 170 towns<i>, into twelve cities, whose names were </i>Cecropia<i>,
  </i>Tetrapolis<i>, </i>Epacria<i>, </i>Decelia<i>, </i>Eleusis<i>,
  </i>Aphydna<i>, </i>Thoricus<i>, </i>Brauron<i>, </i>Cytherus<i>,
  </i>Sphettus<i>, </i>Cephissia<i>, and </i>Phalerus<i>; and that
  </i>Theseus<i> contracted those twelve cities into one, which was
  </i>Athens.</p>

  <p>The original of the Kingdom of the <i>Argives</i> was much after the
  same manner: for <i>Pausanias</i> <a name="NtA_206"
  href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> tells us, <i>that </i>Phoroneus<i>
  the son of </i>Inachus<i> was the first who gathered into one community
  the </i>Argives<i>, who 'till then were scattered, and lived every where
  apart, and the place where they were first assembled was called
  </i>Phoronicum<i>, the city of </i>Phoroneus: and <i>Strabo</i> <a
  name="NtA_207" href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> observes, <i>that
  </i>Homer<i> calls all the places which he reckons up in
  </i>Peloponnesus<i>, a few excepted, not cities but regions, because each
  of them consisted of a convention of many</i> <span lang="el"
  title="dêmoi" >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, <i>free towns,
  out of which afterward noble cities were built and frequented: so the
  </i>Argives<i> composed </i>Mantinæa<i> in </i>Arcadia<i> out of five
  towns, and </i>Tegea<i> out of nine; and out of so many was </i>Heræa<i>
  built by </i>Cleombrotus<i>, or by </i>Cleonymus<i>: so also </i>Ægium<i>
  was built out of seven or eight towns, </i>Patræ<i>: out of seven, and
  </i>Dyme<i> out of eight; and so </i>Elis<i> was erected by the conflux
  of many towns into one city.</i></p>

  <p><i>Pausanias</i> <a name="NtA_208" href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a>
  tells us, that the <i>Arcadians</i> accounted <i>Pelasgus</i> the first
  man, and that he was their first King; and <i>taught the ignorant people
  to built houses, for defending themselves from heat, and cold, and rain;
  and to make them garments of skins; and instead of herbs and roots, which
  were sometimes noxious, to eat the acorns of the beech tree</i>; and that
  his son <i>Lycaon</i> built the oldest city in all <i>Greece</i>: he
  tells us also, that in the days of <i>Lelex</i> the <i>Spartans</i> lived
  in villages apart. The <i>Greeks</i> therefore began to build houses and
  villages in the days of <i>Pelasgus</i> the father of <i>Lycaon</i>, and
  in the days of <i>Lelex</i> the father of <i>Myles</i>, and by
  consequence about two or three Generations before the Flood of
  <i>Deucalion</i>, and the coming of <i>Cadmus</i>; 'till then <a
  name="NtA_209" href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> they lived in woods
  and caves of the earth. The first houses were of clay, 'till the brothers
  <i>Euryalus</i> and <i>Hyperbius</i> taught them to harden the clay into
  bricks, and to build therewith. In the days of <i>Ogyges</i>,
  <i>Pelasgus</i>, <i>Æzeus</i>, <i>Inachus</i> and <i>Lelex</i>, they
  began to build houses and villages of clay, <i>Doxius</i> the son of
  <i>C&#339;lus</i> teaching them to do it; and in the days of
  <i>Lycaon</i>, <i>Phoroneus</i>, <i>Ægialeus</i>, <i>Phegeus</i>,
  <i>Eurotas</i>, <i>Myles</i>, <i>Polycaon</i>, and <i>Cecrops</i>, and
  their sons, to assemble the villages into <span lang="el" title="dêmoi"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, and the <span lang="el"
  title="dêmoi" >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span> into
  cities.</p>

  <p>When <i>Oenotrus</i> the son of <i>Lycaon</i> carried a Colony into
  <i>Italy</i>, <i>he</i> <a name="NtA_210"
  href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> <i>found that country for the most
  part uninhabited; and where it was inhabited, peopled but thinly: and
  seizing a part of it, he built towns in the mountains, little and
  numerous</i>, as above: these towns were without walls; but after this
  Colony grew numerous, and began to want room, <i>they expelled the
  </i>Siculi<i>, compassed many cities with walls, and became possest of
  all the territory between the two rivers </i>Liris<i> and </i>Tibre: and
  it is to be understood that those cities had their Councils and
  <i>Prytanea</i> after the manner of the <i>Greeks</i>: for
  <i>Dionysius</i> <a name="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a>
  tells us, that the new Kingdom of <i>Rome</i>, as <i>Romulus</i> left it,
  consisted of thirty Courts or Councils, in thirty towns, each with the
  sacred fire kept in the <i>Prytaneum</i> of the Court, for the Senators
  who met there to perform Sacred Rites, after the manner of the
  <i>Greeks</i>: <i>but when </i>Numa<i> the successor of </i>Romulus<i>
  Reigned, he leaving the several fires in their own Courts, instituted one
  common to them all at </i>Rome: whence <i>Rome</i> was not a compleat
  city before the days of <i>Numa</i>.</p>

  <p>When navigation was so far improved that the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>
  began to leave the sea-shore, and sail through the <i>Mediterranean</i>
  by the help of the stars, it may be presumed that they began to discover
  the islands of the <i>Mediterranean</i>, and for the sake of trafic to
  sail as far as <i>Greece</i>: and this was not long before they carried
  away <i>Io</i> the daughter of <i>Inachus</i>, from <i>Argos</i>. The
  <i>Cares</i> first infested the <i>Greek</i> seas with piracy, and then
  <i>Minos</i> the son of <i>Europa</i> got up a potent fleet, and sent out
  Colonies: for <i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_212"
  href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> tells us, that the <i>Cyclades</i>
  islands, those near <i>Crete</i>, were at first desolate and uninhabited;
  but <i>Minos</i> having a potent fleet, sent many Colonies out of
  <i>Crete</i>, and peopled many of them; and particularly that the island
  <i>Carpathus</i> was first seized by the soldiers of <i>Minos</i>:
  <i>Syme</i> lay waste and desolate 'till <i>Triops</i> came thither with
  a Colony under <i>Chthonius</i>: <i>Strongyle</i> or <i>Naxus</i> was
  first inhabited by the <i>Thracians</i> in the days of <i>Boreas</i>, a
  little before the <i>Argonautic</i> Expedition: <i>Samsos</i> was, at
  first desert, and inhabited only by a great multitude of terrible wild
  beasts, 'till <i>Macareus</i> peopled it, as he did also the islands
  <i>Chius</i> and <i>Cos</i>. <i>Lesbos</i> lay waste and desolate 'till
  <i>Xanthus</i> sailed thither with a Colony: <i>Tenedos</i> lay desolate
  'till <i>Tennes</i>, a little before the <i>Trojan</i> war, sailed
  thither from <i>Troas</i>. <i>Aristæus</i>, who married <i>Autonoe</i>
  the daughter of <i>Cadmus</i>, carried a Colony from <i>Thebes</i> into
  <i>Cæa</i>, an island not inhabited before: the island <i>Rhodes</i> was
  at first called <i>Ophiusa</i>, being full of serpents, before
  <i>Phorbas</i>, a Prince of <i>Argos</i>, went thither, and made it
  habitable by destroying the serpents, which was about the end of
  <i>Solomon</i>'s Reign; in memory of which he is delineated in the
  heavens in the Constellation of <i>Ophiuchus</i>. The discovery of this
  and some other islands made a report that they rose out of the Sea: <i>in
  Asia Delos emersit, &amp; Hiera, &amp; Anaphe, &amp; Rhodus</i>, saith <a
  name="NtA_213" href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> <i>Ammianus</i>: and
  <a name="NtA_214" href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> <i>Pliny</i>;
  <i>claræ jampridem insulæ, Delos &amp; Rhodos memoriæ produntur enatæ,

  <p><i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_215" href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a>
  tells us also, that the seven islands called <i>Æolides</i>, between
  <i>Italy</i> and <i>Sicily</i>, were desert and uninhabited 'till
  <i>Lipparus</i> and <i>Æolus</i>, a little before the <i>Trojan</i> war,
  went thither from <i>Italy</i>, and peopled them: and that <i>Malta</i>
  and <i>Gaulus</i> or <i>Gaudus</i> on the other side of <i>Sicily</i>,
  were first peopled by <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>; and so was <i>Madera</i>
  without the <i>Straits</i>: and <i>Homer</i> writes that <i>Ulysses</i>
  found the Island <i>Ogygia</i> covered with wood, and uninhabited, except
  by <i>Calypso</i> and her maids, who lived in a cave without houses; and
  it is not likely that <i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Ireland</i> could be
  peopled before navigation was propagated beyond the <i>Straits</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sicaneans</i> were reputed the first inhabitants of
  <i>Sicily</i>, they built little Villages or Towns upon hills, and every
  Town had its own King; and by this means they spread over the country,
  before they formed themselves into larger governments with a common King:
  <i>Philistus</i> <a name="NtA_216" href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a>
  saith that <i>they were transplanted into </i>Sicily<i> from the River
  </i>Sicanus<i> in </i>Spain; and <i>Dionysius</i> <a name="NtA_217"
  href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a>, that <i>they were a </i>Spanish<i>
  people who fled from the </i>Ligures<i> in </i>Italy; he means the
  <i>Ligures</i> <a name="NtA_218" href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> who
  opposed <i>Hercules</i> when he returned from his expedition against
  <i>Geryon</i> in <i>Spain</i>, and endeavoured to pass the <i>Alps</i>
  out of <i>Gaul</i> into <i>Italy</i>. <i>Hercules</i> that year got into
  <i>Italy</i>, and made some conquests there, and founded the city
  <i>Croton</i>; and <a name="NtA_219" href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a>
  after winter, upon the arrival of his fleet from <i>Erythra</i> in
  <i>Spain</i>, sailed to <i>Sicily</i>, and there left the <i>Sicani</i>:
  for <i>it was his custom to recruit his army with conquered people, and
  after they had assisted him in making new conquests to reward them with
  new seats</i>: this was the <i>Egyptian Hercules</i>, who had a potent
  fleet, and in the days of <i>Solomon</i> sailed to the <i>Straits</i>,
  and according to his custom set up pillars there, and conquered
  <i>Geryon</i>, and returned back by <i>Italy</i> and <i>Sicily</i> to
  <i>Egypt</i>, and was by the ancient <i>Gauls</i> called <i>Ogmius</i>,
  and by <i>Egyptians</i> <a name="NtA_220"
  href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> <i>Nilus</i>: for <i>Erythra</i> and
  the country of <i>Geryon</i> were without the <i>Straits</i>.
  <i>Dionysius</i> <a name="NtA_221" href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a>
  represents this <i>Hercules</i> contemporary to <i>Evander</i>.</p>

  <p>The first inhabitants of <i>Crete</i>, according to <i>Diodorus</i> <a
  name="NtA_222" href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> were called
  <i>Eteocretans</i>; but whence they were, and how they came thither, is
  not said in history: then sailed thither a Colony of <i>Pelasgians</i>
  from <i>Greece</i>; and soon after <i>Teutamus</i>, the grandfather of
  <i>Minos</i>, carried thither a Colony of <i>Dorians</i> from
  <i>Laconia</i>, and from the territory of <i>Olympia</i> in
  <i>Peloponnesus</i>: and these several Colonies spake several languages,
  and fed on the spontaeous fruits of the earth, and lived quietly in caves
  and huts, 'till the invention of iron tools, in the days of
  <i>Asterius</i> the son of <i>Teutamus</i>; and at length were reduced
  into one Kingdom, and one People, by <i>Minos</i>, who was their first
  law-giver, and built many towns and ships, and introduced plowing and
  sowing, and in whose days the <i>Curetes</i> conquered his father's
  friends in <i>Crete</i> and <i>Peloponnesus</i>. The <i>Curetes</i> <a
  name="NtA_223" href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> sacrificed children to
  <i>Saturn</i> and according to <i>Bochart</i> <a name="NtA_224"
  href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> were <i>Philistims</i>; and
  <i>Eusebius</i> faith that <i>Crete</i> had its name from <i>Cres</i>,
  one of the <i>Curetes</i> who nursed up <i>Jupiter</i>: but whatever was
  the original of the island, it seems to have been peopled by Colonies
  which spake different languages, 'till the days of <i>Asterius</i> and
  <i>Minos</i>; and might come thither two or three Generations before, and
  not above, for want of navigation in those seas.</p>

  <p>The island <i>Cyprus</i> was discovered by the <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>
  not long before; for <i>Eratosthenes</i> <a name="NtA_225"
  href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> tells us, <i>that </i>Cyprus<i> was
  at first so overgrown with wood that it could not be tilled, and that
  they first cut down the wood for the melting of copper and silver, and
  afterwards when they began to sail safely upon the </i>Mediterranean,
  that is, presently after the <i>Trojan</i> war, <i>they built ships and
  even navies of it: and when they could not thus destroy the wood, they
  gave every man leave to cut down what wood he pleased, and to possess all
  the ground which he cleared of wood</i>. So also <i>Europe</i> at first
  abounded very much with woods, one of which, called the <i>Hercinian</i>,
  took up a great part of <i>Germany</i>, being full nine days journey
  broad, and above forty long, in <i>Julius Cæsar</i>'s days: and yet the
  <i>Europeans</i> had been cutting down their woods, to make room for
  mankind, ever since the invention of iron tools, in the days of
  <i>Asterius</i> and <i>Minos</i>.</p>

  <p>All these footsteps there are of the first peopling of <i>Europe</i>,
  and its Islands, by sea; before those days it seems to have been thinly
  peopled from the northern coast of the <i>Euxine-sea</i> by
  <i>Scythians</i> descended from <i>Japhet</i>, who wandered without
  houses, and sheltered themselves from rain and wild beasts in thickets
  and caves of the earth; such as were the caves in mount <i>Ida</i> in
  <i>Crete</i>, in which <i>Minos</i> was educated and buried; the cave of
  <i>Cacus</i>, and the <i>Catacombs</i> in <i>Italy</i> near <i>Rome</i>
  and <i>Naples</i>, afterwards turned into burying-places; the
  <i>Syringes</i> and many other caves in the sides of the mountains of
  <i>Egypt</i>; the caves of the <i>Troglodites</i> between <i>Egypt</i>
  and the <i>Red Sea</i>, and those of the <i>Phaurusii</i> in
  <i>Afric</i>, mentioned by <a name="NtA_226"
  href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> <i>Strabo</i>; and the caves, and
  thickets, and rocks, and high places, and pits, in which the
  <i>Israelites</i> hid themselves from the <i>Philistims</i> in the days
  of <i>Saul</i>, 1 <i>Sam.</i> xiii. 6. But of the state of mankind in
  <i>Europe</i> in those days there is now no history remaining.</p>

  <p>The antiquities of <i>Libya</i> were not much older than those of
  <i>Europe</i>; for <i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_227"
  href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> tells us, that <i>Uranus</i> the
  father of <i>Hyperion</i>, and grandfather of <i>Helius</i> and
  <i>Selene</i>, that is <i>Ammon</i> the father of <i>Sesac</i>, <i>was
  their first common King, and caused the people, who 'till then wandered
  up and down, to dwell in towns</i>: and <i>Herodotus</i> <a
  name="NtA_228" href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> tells us, that all
  <i>Media</i> was peopled by <span lang="el" title="dêmoi"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, towns without walls, 'till
  they revolted from the <i>Assyrians</i>, which was about 267 years after
  the death of <i>Solomon</i>: and that after that revolt they set up a
  King over them, and built <i>Ecbatane</i> with walls for his seat, the
  first town which they walled about; and about 72 years after the death of
  <i>Solomon</i>, <i>Benhadad</i> King of <i>Syria</i> <a name="NtA_229"
  href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> had two and thirty Kings in his army
  against <i>Ahab</i>: and when <i>Joshuah</i> conquered the land of
  <i>Canaan</i>, every city of the <i>Canaanites</i> had its own King, like
  the cities of <i>Europe</i>, before they conquered one another; and one
  of those Kings, <i>Adonibezek</i>, the King of <i>Bezek</i> had conquered
  seventy other Kings a little before, <i>Judg.</i> i. 7. and therefore
  towns began to be built in that land not many ages before the days of
  <i>Joshuah</i>: for the Patriarchs wandred there in tents, and fed their
  flocks where-ever they pleased, the fields of <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> not
  being yet fully appropriated, for want of people. The countries first
  inhabited by mankind, were in those days so thinly peopled, that <a
  name="NtA_230" href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> four Kings from the
  coasts of <i>Shinar</i> and <i>Elam</i> invaded and spoiled the
  <i>Rephaims</i>, and the inhabitants of the countries of <i>Moab</i>,
  <i>Ammon</i>, <i>Edom</i>, and the Kingdoms of <i>Sodom</i>,
  <i>Gomorrah</i>, <i>Admah</i> and <i>Zeboim</i>; and yet were pursued and
  beaten by <i>Abraham</i> with an armed force of only 318 men, the whole
  force which <i>Abraham</i> and the princes with him could raise: and
  <i>Egypt</i> was so thinly peopled before the birth of <i>Moses</i>, that
  <i>Pharaoh</i> said of the <i>Israelites</i>; <a name="NtA_231"
  href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> <i>behold the people of the children
  of </i>Israel<i> are more and mightier than we</i>: and to prevent their
  multiplying and growing too strong, he caused their male children to be
  drowned.</p>

  <p>These footsteps there are of the first peopling of the earth by
  mankind, not long before the days of <i>Abraham</i>; and of the
  overspreading it with villages, towns and cities, and their growing into
  Kingdoms, first Smaller and then greater, until the rise of the
  Monarchies of <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Assyria</i>, <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Media</i>,
  <i>Persia</i>, <i>Greece</i>, and <i>Rome</i>, the first great Empires on
  this side <i>India</i>. <i>Abraham</i> was the fifth from <i>Peleg</i>,
  and all mankind lived together in <i>Chaldea</i> under the Government of
  <i>Noah</i> and his sons, untill the days of <i>Peleg</i>: so long they
  were of one language, one society, and one religion: and then they
  divided the earth, being perhaps, disturbed by the rebellion of
  <i>Nimrod</i>, and forced to leave off building the tower of
  <i>Babel</i>: and from thence they spread themselves into the several
  countries which fell to their shares, carrying along with them the laws,
  customs and religion, under which they had 'till those days been educated
  and governed, by <i>Noah</i>, and his sons and grandsons: and these laws
  were handed down to <i>Abraham</i>, <i>Melchizedek</i>, and <i>Job</i>,
  and their contemporaries, and for some time were observed by the judges
  of the eastern countries: so <i>Job</i> <a name="NtA_232"
  href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a> tells us, that adultery was <i>an
  heinous crime, yea an iniquity to be punished by the judges</i>: and of
  idolatry he <a name="NtA_233" href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> saith,
  <i>If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness,
  and my heart hath been secretly inticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand,
  this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have
  denied the God that is above</i>: and there being no dispute between
  <i>Job</i> and his friends about these matters, it may be presumed that
  they also with their countrymen were of the same religion.
  <i>Melchizedek</i> was a Priest of the most high God, and <i>Abraham</i>
  voluntarily paid tythes to him; which he would scarce have done had they
  not been of one and the same religion. The first inhabitants of the land
  of <i>Canaan</i> seem also to have been originally of the same religion,
  and to have continued in it 'till the death of <i>Noah</i>, and the days
  of <i>Abraham</i>; for <i>Jerusalem</i> was anciently <a name="NtA_234"
  href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> called <i>Jebus</i>, and its people
  <i>Jebusites</i>, and <i>Melchizedek</i> was their Priest and King: these
  nations revolted therefore after the days of <i>Melchizedek</i> to the
  worship of false Gods; as did also the posterity of <i>Ismael</i>,
  <i>Esau</i>, <i>Moab</i>, <i>Ammon</i>, and that of <i>Abraham</i> by
  <i>Keturah</i>: and the <i>Israelites</i> themselves were very apt to
  revolt: and one reason why <i>Terah</i> went from <i>Ur</i> of the
  <i>Chaldees</i> to <i>Haran</i> in his way to the land of <i>Canaan</i>;
  and why <i>Abraham</i> afterward left <i>Haran</i>, and went into the
  land of <i>Canaan</i>, might be to avoid the worship of false Gods, which
  in their days began in <i>Chaldea</i>, and spread every way from thence;
  but did not yet reach into the land of <i>Canaan</i>. Several of the laws
  and precepts in which this primitive religion consisted are mentioned in
  the book of <i>Job</i>, chap. i. ver. 5, and chap, xxxi, <i>viz.</i>
  <i>not to blaspheme God, nor to worship the Sun or Moon, nor to kill, nor
  steal, nor to commit adultery, nor trust in riches, nor oppress the poor
  or fatherless, nor curse your enemies, nor rejoyce at their misfortunes:
  but to be friendly, and hospitable and merciful, and to relieve the poor
  and needy, and to set up Judges</i>. This was the morality and religion
  of the first ages, still called by the <i>Jews</i>, <i>The precepts of
  the sons of </i>Noah: this was the religion of <i>Moses</i> and the
  Prophets, comprehended in the two great commandments, of <i>loving the
  Lord our God with all our heart and soul and mind, and our neighbour as
  our selves</i>: this was the religion enjoyned by <i>Moses</i> to the
  uncircumcised stranger within the gates of <i>Israel</i>, as well as to
  the <i>Israelites</i>: and this is the primitive religion of both
  <i>Jews</i> and <i>Christians</i>, and ought to be the standing religion
  of all nations, it being for the honour of God, and good of mankind: and
  <i>Moses</i> adds the precept of <i>being merciful even to brute beasts,
  so as not to suck out their blood, nor to cut off their flesh alive with
  the blood in it, nor to kill them for the sake of their blood, nor to
  strangle them; but in killing them for food, to let out their blood and
  spill it upon the ground</i>, <i>Gen.</i> ix. 4, and <i>Levit</i>. xvii.
  12, 13. This law was ancienter than the days of <i>Moses</i>, being given
  to <i>Noah</i> and his sons long before the days of <i>Abraham</i>: and
  therefore when the Apostles and Elders in the Council at <i>Jerusalem</i>
  declared that the Gentiles were not obliged to be circumcised and keep
  the law of <i>Moses</i>, they excepted this law of <i>abstaining from
  blood, and things strangled</i> as being an earlier law of God, imposed
  not on the sons of <i>Abraham</i> only, but on all nations, while they
  lived together in <i>Shinar</i> under the dominion of <i>Noah</i>: and of
  the same kind is the law of <i>abstaining from meats offered to Idols or
  false Gods, and from fornication</i>. So then, <i>the believing that the
  world was framed by one supreme God, and is governed by him; and the
  loving and worshipping him, and honouring our parents, and loving our
  neighbour as our selves, and being merciful even to brute beasts</i>, is
  the oldest of all religions: and the Original of letters, agriculture,
  navigation, music, arts and sciences, metals, smiths and carpenters,
  towns and houses, was not older in <i>Europe</i> than the days of
  <i>Eli</i>, <i>Samuel</i> and <i>David</i>; and before those days the
  earth was so thinly peopled, and so overgrown with woods, that mankind
  could not be much older than is represented in Scripture.</p>

<h2>CHAP. II</h2>

<h3><i>Of the Empire of </i>Egypt<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The <i>Egyptians</i> anciently boasted of a very great and lasting
  Empire under their Kings <i>Ammon</i>, <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Bacchus</i>,
  <i>Sesostris</i>, <i>Hercules</i>, <i>Memnon</i>, &amp;c. reaching
  eastward to the <i>Indies</i>, and westward to the <i>Atlantic Ocean</i>;
  and out of vanity have made this monarchy some thousands of years older
  than the world: let us now try to rectify the Chronology of <i>Egypt</i>;
  by comparing the affairs of <i>Egypt</i> with the synchronizing affairs
  of the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Hebrews</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Bacchus</i> the conqueror loved two women, <i>Venus</i> and
  <i>Ariadne</i>: <i>Venus</i> was the mistress of <i>Anchises</i> and
  <i>Cinyras</i>, and mother of <i>Æneas</i>, who all lived 'till the
  destruction of <i>Troy</i>; and the sons of <i>Bacchus</i> and
  <i>Ariadne</i> were <i>Argonauts</i>; as above: and therefore the great
  <i>Bacchus</i> flourished but one Generation before the <i>Argonautic</i>
  expedition. This <i>Bacchus</i> <a name="NtA_235"
  href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> was potent at sea, conquered eastward
  as far as <i>India</i> returned in triumph, brought his army over the
  <i>Hellespont</i>; conquered <i>Thrace</i>, left music, dancing and
  poetry there; killed <i>Lycurgus</i> King of <i>Thrace</i>, and
  <i>Pentheus</i> the grandson of <i>Cadmus</i>; gave the Kingdom of
  <i>Lycurgus</i> to <i>Tharops</i>; and one of his minstrells, called by
  the <i>Greeks</i> <i>Calliope</i>, to <i>Oeagrus</i> the son of
  <i>Tharops</i>; and of <i>Oeagrus</i> and <i>Calliope</i> was born
  <i>Orpheus</i>, who sailed with the <i>Argonauts</i>: this <i>Bacchus</i>
  was therefore contemporary to <i>Sesostris</i>; and both being Kings of
  <i>Egypt</i>, and potent at sea, and great conquerors, and carrying on
  their conquests into <i>India</i> and <i>Thrace</i>, they must be one and
  the same man.</p>

  <p>The antient <i>Greeks</i>, who made the fables of the Gods, related
  that <i>Io</i> the daughter of <i>Inachus</i> was carried into
  <i>Egypt</i>; and there became the <i>Egyptian Isis</i>; and that
  <i>Apis</i> the son of <i>Phoroneus</i> after death became the God
  <i>Serapis</i>; and some said that <i>Epaphus</i> was the son of
  <i>Io</i>: <i>Serapis</i> and <i>Epaphus</i> are <i>Osiris</i>, and
  therefore <i>Isis</i> and <i>Osiris</i>, in the opinion of the ancient
  <i>Greeks</i> who made the fables of the Gods, were not above two or
  three Generations older than the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition.
  <i>Dicæarchus</i>, as he is cited by the scholiast upon
  <i>Apollonius</i>, <a name="NtA_236" href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a>
  represents them two Generations older than <i>Sesostris</i>, saying that
  after <i>Orus</i> the son of <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i>, Reigned
  <i>Sesonchosis</i>. He seems to have followed the opinion of the people
  of <i>Naxus</i>, who made <i>Bacchus</i> two Generations older than
  <i>Theseus</i>, and for that end feigned two <i>Minos's</i> and two
  <i>Ariadnes</i>; for by the consent of all antiquity <i>Osiris</i> and
  <i>Bacchus</i> were one and the same King of <i>Egypt</i>: this is
  affirmed by the <i>Egyptians</i>, as well as by the <i>Greeks</i>; and
  some of the antient Mythologists, as <i>Eumolpus</i> and <i>Orpheus</i>,
  <a name="NtA_237" href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> called
  <i>Osiris</i> by the names of <i>Dionysus</i> and <i>Sirius</i>.
  <i>Osiris</i> was King of all <i>Egypt</i>, and a great conqueror, and
  came over the <i>Hellespont</i> in the days of <i>Triptolemus</i>, and
  subdued <i>Thrace</i>, and there killed <i>Lycurgus</i>; and therefore
  his expedition falls in with that of the great <i>Bacchus</i>.
  <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Bacchus</i> and <i>Sesostris</i> lived about the same
  time, and by the relation of historians were all of them Kings of all
  <i>Egypt</i>, and Reigned at <i>Thebes</i>, and adorned that city, and
  were very potent by land and sea: all three were great conquerors, and
  carried on their conquests by land through <i>Asia</i> as far as
  <i>India</i>: all three came over the <i>Hellespont</i> and were there in
  danger of losing their army: all three conquered <i>Thrace</i>, and there
  put a stop to their victories, and returned back from thence into
  <i>Egypt</i>: all three left pillars with inscriptions in their
  conquests: and therefore all three must be one and the same King of
  <i>Egypt</i>; and this King can be no other than <i>Sesac</i>. All
  <i>Egypt</i>, including <i>Thebais</i>, <i>Ethiopia</i> and <i>Libya</i>,
  had no common King before the expulsion of the Shepherds who Reigned in
  the lower <i>Egypt</i>; no Conqueror of <i>Syria</i>, <i>India</i>,
  <i>Asia minor</i> and <i>Thrace</i>, before <i>Sesac</i>; and the sacred
  history admits of no <i>Egyptian</i> conqueror of <i>Palestine</i> before
  this King.</p>

  <p><i>Thymætes</i> <a name="NtA_238" href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a>
  who was contemporary to <i>Orpheus</i>, and wrote a poesy called
  <i>Phrygia</i>, of the actions of <i>Bacchus</i> in very old language and
  character, said that <i>Bacchus</i> had <i>Libyan</i> women in his army,
  amongst whom was <i>Minerva</i> a woman born in <i>Libya</i>, near the
  river <i>Triton,</i> and that <i>Bacchus</i> commanded the men and
  <i>Minerva</i> the women. <i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_239"
  href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> calls her <i>Myrina</i>, and saith
  that she was Queen of the <i>Amazons</i> in <i>Libya</i>, and there
  conquered the <i>Atlantides</i> and <i>Gorgons</i>, and then made a
  league with <i>Orus</i> the son of <i>Isis</i>, sent to her by his father
  <i>Osiris</i> or <i>Bacchus</i> for that purpose, and passing through
  <i>Egypt</i> subdued the <i>Arabians</i>, and <i>Syria</i> and
  <i>Cilicia</i>, and came through <i>Phrygia</i>, <i>viz.</i> in the army
  of <i>Bacchus</i> to the <i>Mediterranean</i>; but palling over into
  <i>Europe</i>, was slain with many of her women by the <i>Thracians</i>
  and <i>Scythians</i>, under the conduct of <i>Sipylus</i> a
  <i>Scythian</i>, and <i>Mopsus</i> a <i>Thracian</i> whom <i>Lycurgus</i>
  King of <i>Thrace</i> had banished. This was that <i>Lycurgus</i> who
  opposed the passage of <i>Bacchus</i> over the <i>Hellespont</i>, and was
  soon after conquered by him, and slain: but afterwards <i>Bacchus</i> met
  with a repulse from the <i>Greeks</i>, under the conduct of
  <i>Perseus</i>, who slew many of his women, as <i>Pausanias</i> <a
  name="NtA_240" href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> relates, and was
  assisted by the <i>Scythians</i> and <i>Thracians</i> under the conduct
  of <i>Sipylus</i> and <i>Mopsus</i>; which repulses, together with a
  revolt of his brother <i>Danaus</i> in <i>Egypt</i>; put a stop to his
  victories: and in returning home he left part of his men in
  <i>Colchis</i> and at <i>Mount Caucasus</i>, under <i>Æetes</i> and
  <i>Prometheus</i>; and his women upon the river <i>Thermodon</i> near
  <i>Colchis</i>, under their new Queens <i>Marthesia</i> and
  <i>Lampeto</i>: for <i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_241"
  href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> speaking of the <i>Amazons</i> who
  were seated at <i>Thermodon</i>, saith, that they dwelt originally in
  <i>Libya</i>, and there Reigned over the <i>Atlantides</i>, and invading
  their neighbours conquered as far as <i>Europe</i>: and <i>Ammianus</i>,
  <a name="NtA_242" href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> that the ancient
  <i>Amazons</i> breaking through many nations, attack'd the
  <i>Athenians</i>, and there receiving a great slaughter retired to
  <i>Thermodon</i>: and <i>Justin</i>, <a name="NtA_243"
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> that these <i>Amazons</i> had at
  first, he means at their first coming to <i>Thermodon</i>, two Queens who
  called themselves daughters of <i>Mars</i>; and that they conquered part
  of <i>Europe</i>, and some cities of <i>Asia</i>, <i>viz.</i> in the
  Reign of <i>Minerva</i>, and then sent back part of their army with a
  great booty, under their said new Queens; and that <i>Marthesia</i> being
  afterwards slain, was succeeded by her daughter <i>Orithya</i>, and she
  by <i>Penthesilea</i>; and that <i>Theseus</i> captivated and married
  <i>Antiope</i> the sister of <i>Orithya</i>. <i>Hercules</i> made war
  upon the <i>Amazons</i>, and in the Reign of <i>Orithya</i> and
  <i>Penthesilea</i> they came to the <i>Trojan</i> war: whence the first
  wars of the <i>Amazons</i> in <i>Europe</i> and <i>Asia</i>, and their
  settling at <i>Thermodon</i>, were but one Generation before those
  actions of <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Theseus</i>, and but two before the
  <i>Trojan</i> war, and so fell in with the expedition of
  <i>Sesostris</i>: and since they warred in the days of <i>Isis</i> and
  her son <i>Orus</i>, and were a part of the army of <i>Bacchus</i> or
  <i>Osiris</i>, we have here a further argument for making <i>Osiris</i>

  and the same King with <i>Sesac</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Greeks</i> reckon <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Bacchus</i> to be sons
  of <i>Jupiter</i>, and the <i>Egyptian</i> name of <i>Jupiter</i> is
  <i>Ammon</i>. <i>Manetho</i> in his 11th and 12th <i>Dynasties</i>, as he
  is cited by <i>Africanus</i> and <i>Eusebius</i> names these four Kings
  of <i>Egypt</i>, as reigning in order; <i>Ammenemes</i>,
  <i>Gesongeses</i> or <i>Sesonchoris</i> the son of <i>Ammenemes</i>,
  <i>Ammenemes</i> who was slain by his Eunuchs, and <i>Sesostris</i> who
  subdued all <i>Asia</i> and part of <i>Europe</i>. <i>Gesongeses</i> and
  <i>Sesonchoris</i> are corruptly written for <i>Sesonchosis</i>; and the
  two first of these four Kings, <i>Ammenemes</i> and <i>Sesonchosis</i>,
  are the same with the two last, <i>Ammenemes</i> and <i>Sesostris</i>,
  that is, with <i>Ammon</i> and <i>Sesac</i>; for <i>Diodorus</i> saith <a
  name="NtA_244" href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> that <i>Osiris</i>
  built in <i>Thebes</i> a magnificent temple to his parents <i>Jupiter</i>
  and <i>Juno</i>, and two other temples to <i>Jupiter</i>, a larger to
  <i>Jupiter Uranius</i>, and a less to his father <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> who
  reigned in that city: and <a name="NtA_245"
  href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> <i>Thymætes</i> abovementioned, who
  was contemporary to <i>Orpheus</i>, wrote expresly that the father of
  <i>Bacchus</i> was <i>Ammon</i>, a King Reigning over part of
  <i>Libya</i>, that is, a King of <i>Egypt</i> Reigning over all that part
  of <i>Libya</i>, anciently called <i>Ammonia</i>. <i>Stephanus</i> <a

  </i>Libya<i> was anciently called </i>Ammonia<i> from </i>Ammon: this is
  that King of <i>Egypt</i> from whom <i>Thebes</i> was called
  <i>No-Ammon</i>, and <i>Ammon-no</i> the city of <i>Ammon</i>, and by the
  <i>Greeks Diospolis</i>, the city of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>:
  <i>Sesostris</i> built it sumptuously, and called it by his father's
  name, and from the same King the <a name="NtA_247"
  href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> River called <i>Ammon</i>, the people
  called <i>Ammonii</i>, and the <a name="NtA_248"
  href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> promontory <i>Ammonium</i> in
  <i>Arabia fælix</i> had their names.</p>

  <p>The lower part of <i>Egypt</i> being yearly overflowed by the
  <i>Nile</i>, was scarce inhabited before the invention of corn, which
  made it useful: and the King, who by this invention first peopled it and
  Reigned over it, perhaps the King of the city <i>Mesir</i> where
  <i>Memphis</i> was afterwards built, seems to have been worshipped by his
  subjects after death, in the ox or calf, for this benefaction: for this
  city stood in the most convenient place to people the lower <i>Egypt</i>,
  and from its being composed of two parts seated on each side of the river
  <i>Nile</i>, might give the name of <i>Mizraim</i> to its founder and
  people; unless you had rather refer the word to the double people, those
  above the <i>Delta</i>, and those within it: and this I take to be the
  state of the lower <i>Egypt</i>, 'till the Shepherds or
  <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> who fled from <i>Joshuah</i> conquered it, and
  being afterwards conquered by the <i>Ethiopians</i>, fled into
  <i>Afric</i> and other places: for there was a tradition that some of
  them fled into <i>Afric</i>; and St. <i>Austin</i> <a name="NtA_249"
  href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> confirms this, by telling us that the
  common people of <i>Afric</i> being asked who they were, replied
  <i>Chanani</i>, that is, <i>Canaanites</i>. <i>Interrogati rustici
  nostri</i>, saith he, <i>quid sint, Punice respondentes Chanani, corrupta
  scilicet voce sicut in talibus solet, quid aliud respondent quam
  Chanaanæi?</i> <i>Procopius</i> also <a name="NtA_250"
  href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> tells us of two pillars in the west
  of <i>Afric</i>, with inscriptions signifying that the people were
  <i>Canaanites</i> who fled from <i>Joshuah</i>: and <i>Eusebius</i> <a
  name="NtA_251" href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> tells us, that these
  <i>Canaanites</i> flying from the sons of <i>Israel</i>, built
  <i>Tripolis</i> in <i>Afric</i>; and the <i>Jerusalem Gemara</i>, <a
  name="NtA_252" href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> that the
  <i>Gergesites</i> fled from <i>Joshua</i>, going into <i>Afric</i>: and

  of the <i>Moors</i>, described also by <i>Procopius</i> and by their
  being unacquainted with merchandise and sea-affairs, you may know that
  they were <i>Canaanites</i> originally, and peopled <i>Afric</i> before
  the <i>Tyrian</i> merchants came thither. These <i>Canaanites</i> coming
  from the East, pitched their tents in great numbers in the lower
  <i>Egypt</i>, in the Reign of <i>Timaus</i>, as <a name="NtA_253"
  href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> <i>Manetho</i> writes, and easily
  seized the country, and fortifying <i>Pelusium</i>, then called
  <i>Abaris</i>, they erected a Kingdom there, and Reigned long under their
  own Kings, <i>Salatis</i>, <i>B&#339;on</i>, <i>Apachnas</i>,
  <i>Apophis</i>, <i>Janias</i>, <i>Assis</i>, and others successively: and
  in the mean time the upper part of <i>Egypt</i> called <i>Thebais</i>,
  and according to <a name="NtA_254" href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a>
  <i>Herodotus</i>, <i>Ægyptus</i>, and in Scripture the land of
  <i>Pathros</i>, was under other Kings, Reigning perhaps at <i>Coptos</i>,
  and <i>Thebes</i>, and <i>This</i>, and <i>Syene</i>, and <a
  name="NtA_255" href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> <i>Pathros</i>, and
  <i>Elephantis</i>, and <i>Heracleopolis</i>, and <i>Mesir</i>, and other
  great cities, 'till they conquered one another, or were conquered by the
  <i>Ethiopians</i>: for cities grew great in those days, by being the
  seats of Kingdoms: but at length one of these Kingdoms conquered the
  rest, and made a lasting war upon the Shepherds, and in the Reign of its
  King <i>Misphragmuthosis</i>, and his son <i>Amosis</i>, called also
  <i>Tethmosis</i>, <i>Tuthmosis</i>, and <i>Thomosis</i>, drove them out
  of <i>Egypt</i>, and made them fly into <i>Afric</i> and <i>Syria</i>,
  and other places, and united all <i>Egypt</i> into one Monarchy; and
  under their next Kings, <i>Ammon</i> and <i>Sesac</i>, enlarged it into a
  great Empire. This conquering people worshipped not the Kings of the
  Shepherds whom they conquered and expelled, but <a name="NtA_256"
  href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> abolished their religion of
  sacrificing men, and after the manner of those ages Deified their own
  Kings, who founded their new Dominion, beginning the history of their
  Empire with the Reign and great acts of their Gods and Heroes: whence
  their Gods <i>Ammon</i> and <i>Rhea</i>, or <i>Uranus</i> and
  <i>Titæa</i>; <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i>; <i>Orus</i> and
  <i>Bubaste</i>: and their Secretary <i>Thoth</i>, and Generals
  <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Pan</i>; and Admiral <i>Japetus</i>,
  <i>Neptune</i>, or <i>Typhon</i>; were all of them <i>Thebans</i>, and
  flourished after the expulsion of the Shepherds. <i>Homer</i> places
  <i>Thebes</i> in <i>Ethiopia</i>, and the <i>Ethiopians</i> reported that
  <a name="NtA_257" href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> the
  <i>Egyptians</i> were a colony drawn out of them by <i>Osiris</i>, and
  that thence it came to pass that most of the laws of <i>Egypt</i> were
  the same with those of <i>Ethiopia</i>, and that the <i>Egyptians</i>
  learnt from the <i>Ethiopians</i> the custom of Deifying their Kings.</p>

  <p>When <i>Joseph</i> entertained his brethren in <i>Egypt</i>, they did
  eat at a table by themselves, and he did eat at another table by himself;
  and the <i>Egyptians</i> who did eat with him were at another table,
  <i>because the </i>Egyptians<i> might not eat bread with the
  </i>Hebrews<i>; for that was an abomination to the </i>Egyptians,
  <i>Gen.</i> xliii. 32. These <i>Egyptians</i> who did eat with
  <i>Joseph</i> were of the Court of <i>Pharaoh</i>; and therefore
  <i>Pharaoh</i> and his Court were at this time not Shepherds but genuine
  <i>Egyptians</i>; and these <i>Egyptians</i> abominated eating bread with
  the <i>Hebrews</i>, at one and the same table: and of these
  <i>Egyptians</i> and their fellow-subjects, it is said a little after,
  that <i>every Shepherd is an abomination to the </i>Egyptians:
  <i>Egypt</i> at this time was therefore under the government of the
  genuine <i>Egyptians</i>, and not under that of the Shepherds.</p>

  <p>After the descent of <i>Jacob</i> and his sons into <i>Egypt</i>,
  <i>Joseph</i> lived 70 years, and so long continued in favour with the
  Kings of <i>Egypt</i>: and 64 years after his death <i>Moses</i> was
  born: and between the death of <i>Joseph</i> and the birth of
  <i>Moses</i>, <i>there arose up a new King over </i>Egypt<i>, which knew
  not </i>Joseph, <i>Exod.</i> i. 8. But this King of <i>Egypt</i> was not
  one of the Shepherds; for he is called <i>Pharaoh</i>, <i>Exod.</i> i.
  11, 22: and <i>Moses</i> told his successor, that if the people of
  <i>Israel</i> should sacrifice in the land of <i>Egypt</i>, <i>they
  should sacrifice the abomination of the </i>Egyptians<i> before their
  eyes, and the </i>Egyptians<i> would stone them</i>, <i>Exod.</i> viii.
  26. that is, they should sacrifice sheep or oxen, contrary to the
  religion of <i>Egypt</i>. The Shepherds therefore did not Reign over
  <i>Egypt</i> while <i>Israel</i> was there, but either were driven out of
  <i>Egypt</i> before <i>Israel</i> went down thither, or did not enter
  into <i>Egypt</i> 'till after <i>Moses</i> had brought <i>Israel</i> from
  thence: and the latter must be true, if they were driven out of
  <i>Egypt</i> a little before the building of the temple of
  <i>Solomon</i>, as <i>Manetho</i> affirms.</p>

  <p><i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_258" href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a>
  saith in his 40th book, <i>that in </i>Egypt<i> there were formerly
  multitudes of strangers of several nations, who used foreign rites and
  ceremonies in worshipping the Gods, for which they were expelled
  </i>Egypt<i>; and under </i>Danaus<i>, </i>Cadmus<i>, and other skilful
  commanders, after great hardships, came into </i>Greece<i>, and other
  places; but the greatest part of them came into </i>Judæa<i>, not far
  from </i>Egypt<i>, a country then uninhabited and desert, being conducted
  thither by one </i>Moses<i>, a wise and valiant man, who after he had
  possest himself of the country, among other things built
  </i>Jerusalem<i>, and the Temple.</i> <i>Diodorus</i> here mistakes the
  original of the <i>Israelites</i>, as <i>Manetho</i> had done before,
  confounding their flight into the wilderness under the conduct of
  <i>Moses</i>, with the flight of the Shepherds from
  <i>Misphragmuthosis</i>, and his son <i>Amosis</i>, into
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and <i>Afric</i>; and not knowing that <i>Judæa</i>
  was inhabited by <i>Canaanites</i>, before the <i>Israelites</i> under
  <i>Moses</i> came thither: but however, he lets us know that the
  Shepherds were expelled <i>Egypt</i> by <i>Amosis</i>, a little before
  the building of <i>Jerusalem</i> and the Temple, and that after several
  hardships several of them came into <i>Greece</i>, and other places,
  under the conduct of <i>Cadmus</i>, and other Captains, but the most of
  them Settled in <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> next <i>Egypt</i>. We may reckon
  therefore that the expulsion of the Shepherds by the Kings of
  <i>Thebais</i>, was the occasion that the <i>Philistims</i> were so
  numerous in the days of <i>Saul</i>; and that so many men came in those
  times with colonies out of <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> into
  <i>Greece</i>; as <i>Lelex</i>, <i>Inachus</i>, <i>Pelasgus</i>,
  <i>Æzeus</i>, <i>Cecrops</i>, <i>Ægialeus</i>, <i>Cadmus</i>,
  <i>Ph&#339;nix</i>, <i>Membliarius</i>, <i>Alymnus</i>, <i>Abas</i>,
  <i>Erechtheus</i>, <i>Peteos</i>, <i>Phorbas</i>, in the days of
  <i>Eli</i>, <i>Samuel</i>, <i>Saul</i> and <i>David</i>: some of them
  fled in the days of <i>Eli</i>, from <i>Misphragmuthosis</i>, who
  conquered part of the lower <i>Egypt</i>; others retired from his
  Successor <i>Amosis</i> into <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, and <i>Arabia
  Petræa</i>, and there mixed with the old inhabitants; who not long after
  being conquered by <i>David</i>, fled from him and the <i>Philistims</i>
  by sea, under the conduct of <i>Cadmus</i> and other Captains, into
  <i>Asia Minor</i>, <i>Greece</i>, and <i>Libya</i>, to seek new seats,
  and there built towns, erected Kingdoms, and set on foot the worship of
  the dead: and some of those who remained in <i>Judæa</i> might assist
  <i>David</i> and <i>Solomon</i>, in building <i>Jerusalem</i> and the
  Temple. Among the foreign rites used by the strangers in <i>Egypt</i>, in
  worshipping the Gods, was the sacrificing of men; for <i>Amosis</i>
  abolished that custom at <i>Heliopolis</i>: and therefore those strangers
  were <i>Canaanites</i>, such as fled from <i>Joshua</i>; for the
  <i>Canaanites</i> gave their seed, that is, their children, to
  <i>Moloch</i>, <i>and burnt their sons and their daughters in the fire to
  their Gods</i>, <i>Deut.</i> xii. 31. <i>Manetho</i> calls them
  <i>Ph&#339;nician</i> strangers.</p>

  <p>After <i>Amosis</i> had expelled the Shepherds, and extended his
  dominion over all <i>Egypt</i>, his son and Successor <i>Ammenemes</i> or
  <i>Ammon</i>, by much greater conquests laid the foundation of the
  <i>Egyptian</i> Empire: for by the assistance of his young son
  <i>Sesostris</i>, whom he brought up to hunting and other laborious
  exercises, he conquered <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Troglodytica</i>, and
  <i>Libya</i>: and from him all <i>Libya</i> was anciently called
  <i>Ammonia</i>: and after his death, in the temples erected to him at
  <i>Thebes</i>, and in <i>Ammonia</i> and at <i>Meroe</i> in
  <i>Ethiopia</i>, they set up Oracles to him, and made the people worship
  him as the God that acted in them: and these are the oldest Oracles
  mentioned in history; the <i>Greeks</i> therein imitating the
  <i>Egyptians</i>: for the <a name="NtA_259"
  href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> Oracle at <i>Dodona</i> was the
  oldest in <i>Greece</i>, and was set up by an <i>Egyptian</i> woman,
  after the example of the Oracle of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> at
  <i>Thebes</i>.</p>

  <p>In the days of <i>Ammon</i> a body of the <i>Edomites</i> fled from
  <i>David</i> into <i>Egypt</i>, with their young King <i>Hadad</i>, as
  above; and carried thither their skill in navigation: and this seems to
  have given occasion to the <i>Egyptians</i> to build a fleet on the
  <i>Red Sea</i> near <i>Coptos</i>, and might ingratiate <i>Hadad</i> with
  <i>Pharaoh</i>: for the <i>Midianites</i> and <i>Ishmaelites</i>, who
  bordered upon the <i>Red Sea</i>, near <i>Mount Horeb</i> on the
  south-side of <i>Edom</i>, were merchants from the days of <i>Jacob</i>
  the Patriarch, <i>Gen.</i> xxxvii. 28, 36. and by their merchandise the
  <i>Midianites</i> abounded with gold in the days of <i>Moses</i>,
  <i>Numb.</i> xxxi. 50, 51, 52. and in the days of the judges of
  <i>Israel</i>, <i>because they were </i>Ishmaelites, <i>Judg.</i> viii
  24. The <i>Ishmaelites</i> therefore in those days grew rich by
  merchandise; they carried their merchandise on camels through
  <i>Petra</i> to <i>Rhinocolura</i>, and thence to <i>Egypt</i>: and this
  trafic at length came into the hands of <i>David</i>, by his conquering
  the <i>Edomites</i>, and gaining the ports of the <i>Red Sea</i> called
  <i>Eloth</i> and <i>Ezion-Geber</i>, as may be understood by the 3000
  talents of gold of <i>Ophir</i>, which <i>David</i> gave to the Temple, 1
  <i>Chron.</i> xxix. 4. The <i>Egyptians</i> having the art of making
  linen-cloth, they began about this time to build long Ships with sails,
  in their port on those Seas near <i>Coptos</i>, and having learnt the
  skill of the <i>Edomites</i>, they began now to observe the positions of
  the Stars, and the length of the Solar Year, for enabling them to know
  the position of the Stars at any time, and to sail by them at all times,
  without sight of the shoar: and this gave a beginning to Astronomy and
  Navigation: for hitherto they had gone only by the shoar with oars, in
  round vessels of burden, first invented on that shallow sea by the
  posterity of <i>Abraham</i>, and in passing from island to island guided
  themselves by the sight of the islands in the day time, or by the sight
  of some of the Stars in the night. Their old year was the Lunisolar year,
  derived from <i>Noah</i> to all his posterity, 'till those days, and
  consisted of twelve months, each of thirty days, according to their
  calendar: and to the end of this calendar-year they now added five days,
  and thereby made up the Solar year of twelve months and five days, or 365
  days.</p>

  <p>The ancient <i>Egyptians</i> feigned <a name="NtA_260"
  href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> that <i>Rhea</i> lay secretly with
  <i>Saturn</i>, and <i>Sol</i> prayed that she might bring forth neither
  in any month, nor in the year; and that <i>Mercury</i> playing at dice
  with <i>Luna</i>, overcame, and took from the Lunar year the 72d part of
  every day, and thereof composed five days, and added them to the year of
  360 days, that she might bring forth in them; and that the
  <i>Egyptians</i> celebrated those days as the birth-days of <i>Rhea</i>'s
  five children, <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Orus</i> senior, <i>Typhon</i>,
  <i>Isis</i>, and <i>Nephthe</i> the wife of <i>Typhon</i>: and therefore,
  according to the opinion of the ancient <i>Egyptians</i>, the five days
  were added to the Lunisolar calendar-year, in the Reign of <i>Saturn</i>
  and <i>Rhea</i>, the parents of <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, and
  <i>Typhon</i>; that is, in the Reign of <i>Ammon</i> and <i>Titæa</i>,
  the parents of the <i>Titans</i>; or in the latter half of the Reign of
  <i>David</i>, when those <i>Titans</i> were born, and by consequence soon
  after the flight of the <i>Edomites</i> from <i>David</i> into
  <i>Egypt</i>: but the Solstices not being yet settled, the beginning of
  this new year might not be fixed to the Vernal Equinox before the Reign
  of <i>Amenophis</i> the successor of <i>Orus</i> junior, the Son of
  <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i>.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Edomites</i> fled from <i>David</i> with their young King
  <i>Hadad</i> into <i>Egypt</i>, it is probable that they carried thither
  also the use of letters: for letters were then in use among the posterity
  of <i>Abraham</i> in <i>Arabia Petræa</i>, and upon the borders of the
  <i>Red Sea</i>, the Law being written there by <i>Moses</i> in a book,
  and in tables of stone, long before: for <i>Moses</i> marrying the
  daughter of the prince of <i>Midian</i>, and dwelling with him forty
  years, learnt them among the <i>Midianites</i>: and <i>Job</i>, who lived
  <a name="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> among their
  neighbours the <i>Edomites</i>, mentions the writing down or words, as
  there in use in his days, <i>Job.</i> xix. 23, 24. and there is no
  instance of letters for writing down sounds, being in use before the days
  of <i>David</i>, in any other nation besides the posterity of
  <i>Abraham</i>. The <i>Egyptians</i> ascribed this invention to
  <i>Thoth</i>, the secretary of <i>Osiris</i>; and therefore Letters began
  to be in use in <i>Egypt</i> in the days of <i>Thoth</i>, that is, a
  little after the flight of the <i>Edomites</i> from <i>David</i>, or
  about the time that <i>Cadmus</i> brought them into <i>Europe</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Helladius</i> <a name="NtA_262" href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a>
  tells us, that a man called <i>Oes</i>, who appeared in the <i>Red
  Sea</i> with the tail of a fish, so they painted a sea-man, taught
  Astronomy and Letters: and <i>Hyginus</i>, <a name="NtA_263"
  href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> that <i>Euhadnes</i>, who came out of
  the Sea in <i>Chaldæa</i>, taught the <i>Chaldæans</i> Astrology the
  first of any man; he means Astronomy: and <i>Alexander Polyhistor</i> <a
  name="NtA_264" href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> tells us from
  <i>Berosus</i>, that <i>Oannes</i> taught the <i>Chaldæans</i> Letters,
  Mathematicks, Arts, Agriculture, Cohabitation in Cities, and the
  Construction of Temples; and that several such men came thither
  successively. <i>Oes</i>, <i>Euhadnes</i>, and <i>Oannes</i>, seem to be
  the same name a little varied by corruption; and this name seems to have
  been given in common to several sea-men, who came thither from time to
  time, and by consequence were merchants, and frequented those seas with
  their merchandise, or else fled from their enemies: so that Letters,
  Astronomy, Architecture and Agriculture, came into <i>Chaldæa</i> by sea,
  and were carried thither by sea-men, who frequented the <i>Persian
  Gulph</i>, and came thither from time to time, after all those things
  were practised in other countries whence they came, and by consequence in
  the days of <i>Ammon</i> and <i>Sesac</i>, <i>David</i> and
  <i>Solomon</i>, and their successors, or not long before. The
  <i>Chaldæans</i> indeed made <i>Oannes</i> older than the flood of
  <i>Xisuthrus</i>, but the <i>Egyptians</i> made <i>Osiris</i> as old, and
  I make them contemporary.</p>

  <p>The <i>Red Sea</i> had its name not from its colour, but from
  <i>Edom</i> and <i>Erythra</i>, the names of <i>Esau</i>, which signify
  that colour: and some <a name="NtA_265"
  href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> tell us, that King <i>Erythra</i>,
  meaning <i>Esau</i>, invented the vessels, <i>rates</i>, in which they
  navigated that Sea, and was buried in an island thereof near the
  <i>Persian Gulph</i>: whence it follows, that the <i>Edomites</i>
  navigated that Sea from the days of <i>Esau</i>; and there is no need
  that the oldest <i>Oannes</i> should be older. There were boats upon
  rivers before, such as were the boats which carried the Patriarchs over
  <i>Euphrates</i> and <i>Jordan</i>, and the first nations over many other
  rivers, for peopling the earth, seeking new seats, and invading one
  another's territories: and after the example of such vessels,
  <i>Ishhmael</i> and <i>Midian</i> the sons of <i>Abraham</i>, and
  <i>Esau</i> his grandson, might build larger vessels to go to the islands
  upon the <i>Red Sea</i>, in searching for new seats, and by degrees learn
  to navigate that sea, as far as to the <i>Persian Gulph</i>: for ships
  were as old, even upon the <i>Mediterranean</i>, as the days of
  <i>Jacob</i>, <i>Gen.</i> xlix. 13. <i>Judg.</i> v. 17. but it is
  probable that the merchants of that sea were not forward to discover
  their Arts and Sciences, upon which their trade depended: it seems
  therefore that Letters and Astronomy, and the trade of Carpenters, were
  invented by the merchants of the <i>Red Sea</i>, for writing down their
  merchandise, and keeping their accounts, and guiding their ships in the
  night by the Stars, and building ships; and that they were propagated
  from <i>Arabia Petræa</i> into <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Chaldæa</i>,
  <i>Syria</i>, <i>Asia minor</i>, and <i>Europe</i>, much about one and
  the same time; the time in which <i>David</i> conquered and dispersed
  those merchants: for we hear nothing of Letters before the days of
  <i>David</i>, except among the posterity of <i>Abraham</i>; nothing of
  Astronomy, before the <i>Egyptians</i> under <i>Ammon</i> and
  <i>Sesac</i> applied themselves to that study, except the Constellations
  mentioned by <i>Job</i>, who lived in <i>Arabia Petræa</i> among the
  merchants; nothing of the trade of Carpenters, or good Architecture,
  before <i>Solomon</i> sent to <i>Hiram</i> King of <i>Tyre</i>, to supply
  him with such Artificers, saying that <i>there were none in </i>Israel<i>
  who could skill to hew timber like the </i>Zidonians.</p>

  <p><i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_266" href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a>
  tells us, <i>that the </i>Egyptians<i> sent many colonies out of
  </i>Egypt<i> into other countries; and that </i>Belus<i>, the son of
  </i>Neptune<i> and </i>Libya<i>, carried colonies thence into
  </i>Babylonia<i>, and seating himself on </i>Euphrates<i>, instituted
  priests free from taxes and publick expences, after the manner of
  </i>Egypt<i>, who were called </i>Chaldæans<i>, and who after the manner
  of </i>Egypt<i>, might observe the Stars</i>: and <i>Pausanias</i> <a
  name="NtA_267" href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> tells us, <i>that the
  </i>Belus<i> of the </i>Babylonians<i> had his name from </i>Belus<i> an
  </i>Egyptian<i>, the son of </i>Libya: and <i>Apollodorus</i>; <a
  name="NtA_268" href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> <i>that </i>Belus<i>
  the son of </i>Neptune<i> and </i>Libya<i>, and King of </i>Egypt<i>, was
  the father of </i>Ægyptus<i> and </i>Danaus, that is, <i>Ammon</i>: he
  tells us also, <i>that </i>Busiris<i> the son of </i>Neptune<i> and
  </i>Lisianassa<i> </i>[Libyanassa]<i> the daughter of </i>Epaphus<i>, was
  King of </i>Egypt; and <i>Eusebius</i> calls this King, Busiris<i> the
  son of </i>Neptune<i>, and of </i>Libya<i> the daughter of </i>Epaphus.
  By these things the later <i>Egyptians</i> seem to have made two
  <i>Belus's</i>, the one the father of <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, and
  <i>Neptune</i>, the other the son of <i>Neptune</i>, and father of
  <i>Ægyptus</i> and <i>Danaus</i>: and hence came the opinion of the
  people of <i>Naxus</i>, that there were two <i>Minos's</i> and two
  <i>Ariadnes</i>, the one two Generations older than the other; which we
  have confuted. The father of <i>Ægyptus</i> and <i>Danaus</i> was the
  father of <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, and <i>Typhon</i>; and
  <i>Typhon</i> was not the grandfather of <i>Neptune</i>, but
  <i>Neptune</i> himself.</p>

  <p><i>Sesostris</i> being brought up to hard labour by his father
  <i>Ammon</i>, warred first under his father, being the Hero or
  <i>Hercules</i> of the <i>Egyptians</i> during his father's Reign, and
  afterward their King: under his father, whilst he was very young, he
  invaded and conquered <i>Troglodytica</i>, and thereby secured the
  harbour of the <i>Red Sea</i>, near <i>Coptos</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, and
  then he invaded <i>Ethiopia</i>, and carried on his conquest southward,
  as far as to the region bearing cinnamon: and his father by the
  assistance of the <i>Edomites</i> having built a fleet on the <i>Red
  Sea</i>, he put to sea, and coasted <i>Arabia Fælix</i>, going to the
  <i>Persian Gulph</i> and beyond, and in those countries set up Columns
  with inscriptions denoting his conquests; and particularly he Set up a
  Pillar at <i>Dira</i>, a promontory in the straits of the <i>Red Sea</i>,
  next <i>Ethiopia</i>, and two Pillars in <i>India</i>, on the mountains
  near the mouth of the rivers <i>Ganges</i>; so <a name="NtA_269"

  that <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> was worshipped in <i>Ammonia</i>, and

  <p>The <i>Arabians</i> worshipped only two Gods, <i>C&#339;lus</i>,
  otherwise called <i>Ouranus</i>, or <i>Jupiter Uranius</i>, and
  <i>Bacchus</i>: and these were <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> and <i>Sesac</i>, as

  <p>At length <i>Sesostris</i>, in the fifth year of <i>Rehoboam</i>, came
  out of <i>Egypt</i> with a great army of <i>Libyans</i>,
  <i>Troglodytes</i> and <i>Ethiopians</i>, and spoiled the Temple, and
  reduced <i>Judæa</i> into servitude, and went on conquering, first
  eastward toward <i>India</i>, which he invaded, and then westward as far

  singing women, called <i>the Muses</i>, one of which, called
  <i>Calliope</i>, was the mother of <i>Orpheus</i> an <i>Argonaut</i>: and

  <p>In the fourteenth year of <i>Rehoboam</i> he returned back into

  <i>Prometheus</i> at mount <i>Caucasus</i>, with part of his army, to
  defend his conquests from the <i>Scythians</i>. <i>Apollonius Rhodius</i>
  <a name="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> and his scholiast
  tell us, that <i>Sesonchosis</i> King of all <i>Egypt</i>, that is
  <i>Sesac</i>, invading all <i>Asia</i>, and a great part of
  <i>Europe</i>, peopled many cities which he took; and that <i>Æa</i>, the

  the posterity of those </i>Egyptians<i> which he placed there, and that
  they preserved pillars or tables in which all the journies and the bounds
  of sea and land were described, for the use of them that were to go any

  <p><i>Sesostris</i> upon his returning home <a name="NtA_279"
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> divided <i>Egypt</i> by measure
  amongst the <i>Egyptians</i>; and this gave a beginning to Surveying and

  <i>Jamblicus</i> derives this division of <i>Egypt</i>, and beginning of
  Geometry, from the Age of the Gods of <i>Egypt</i>. <i>Sesostris</i> also
  <a name="NtA_281" href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> divided
  <i>Egypt</i> into 36 <i>Nomes</i> or Counties, and dug a canal from the
  <i>Nile</i> to the head city of every <i>Nome</i>, and with the earth dug
  out of it, he caused the ground of the city to be raised higher, and
  built a Temple in every city for the worship of the <i>Nome</i>, and in
  the Temples set up Oracles, some of which remained 'till the days of
  <i>Herodotus</i>: and by this means the <i>Egyptians</i> of every
  <i>Nome</i> were induced to worship the great men of the Kingdom, to whom
  the <i>Nome</i>, the City, and the Temple or Sepulchre of the God, was
  dedicated: for every Temple had its proper God, and modes of worship, and
  annual festivals, at which the Council and People of the <i>Nome</i> met
  at certain times to sacrifice, and regulate the affairs of the
  <i>Nome</i>, and administer justice, and buy and sell; but <i>Sesac</i>
  and his Queen, by the names of <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i>, were
  worshipped in all <i>Egypt</i>: and because <i>Sesac</i>, to render the
  <i>Nile</i> more useful, dug channels from it to all the capital cities
  of <i>Egypt</i>; that river was consecrated to him, and he was called by
  its names, <i>Ægyptus</i>, <i>Siris</i>, <i>Nilus</i>. <i>Dionysius</i>
  <a name="NtA_282" href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> tells us, that the
  <i>Nile</i> was called <i>Siris</i> by the <i>Ethiopians</i>, and
  <i>Nilus</i> by the people of <i>Siene</i>. From the word <i>Nahal</i>,
  which signifies a torrent, that river was called <i>Nilus</i>; and
  <i>Dionysius</i> <a name="NtA_283" href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a>
  tells us, that <i>Nilus</i> was that King who cut <i>Egypt</i> into
  canals, to make the river useful: in Scripture the river is called
  <i>Schichor</i>, or <i>Sihor</i>, and thence the <i>Greeks</i> formed the
  words <i>Siris</i>, <i>Sirius</i>, <i>Ser-Apis</i>, <i>O-Siris</i>; but
  <i>Plutarch</i> <a name="NtA_284" href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a>
  tells us, that the syllable <i>O</i>, put before the word <i>Siris</i> by
  the <i>Greeks</i>, made it scarce intelligible to the
  <i>Egyptians</i>.</p>

  <p>I have now told you the original of the <i>Nomes</i> of <i>Egypt</i>
  and of the Religions and Temples of the <i>Nomes</i>, and of the Cities
  built there by the Gods, and called by their names: whence
  <i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_285" href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a>
  tells us, that <i>of all the Provinces of the World, there were in
  </i>Egypt<i> only many cities built by the ancient Gods, as by
  </i>Jupiter<i>, </i>Sol<i>, </i>Hermes<i>, </i>Apollo<i>, </i>Pan<i>,
  </i>Eilithyia<i>, and, many others</i>: and <i>Lucian</i> <a
  name="NtA_286" href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> an <i>Assyrian</i>,
  who had travelled into <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and <i>Egypt</i>, tells us,
  that <i>the Temples of </i>Egypt<i> were very old, those in
  </i>Ph&#339;nicia<i> built by </i>Cinyras<i> as old, and those in
  </i>Assyria<i> almost as old as the former, but not altogether so
  old</i>: which shews that the Monarchy of <i>Assyria</i> rose up after
  the Monarchy of <i>Egypt</i>; as is represented in Scripture; and that
  the Temples of <i>Egypt</i> then standing, were those built by
  <i>Sesostris</i>, about the same time that the Temples of
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and <i>Cyprus</i> were built by <i>Cinyras<i>,
  </i>Benhadad</i>, and <i>Hiram</i>. This was not the first original of
  Idolatry, but only the erecting of much more sumptuous Temples than
  formerly to the founders of new Kingdoms: for Temples at first were very
  small;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p class="i4"><i>Ovid. Fast.</i> l. 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Altars were at first erected without Temples, and this custom
  continued in <i>Persia</i> 'till after the days of <i>Herodotus</i>: in
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> they had Altars with little houses for eating the
  sacrifices much earlier, and these they called High Places: such was the
  High Place where <i>Samuel</i> entertained <i>Saul</i>; such was the
  House of <i>Dagon</i> at <i>Ashdod</i>, into which the <i>Philistims</i>
  brought the Ark; and the House of <i>Baal</i>, in which <i>Jehu</i> slew
  the Prophets of <i>Baal</i>; and such were the High Places of the
  <i>Canaanites</i> which <i>Moses</i> commanded <i>Israel</i> to destroy:
  he <a name="NtA_287" href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> commanded
  <i>Israel</i> to destroy the Altars, Images, High Places, and Groves of
  the <i>Canaanites</i>, but made no mention of their Temples, as he would
  have done had there been any in those days. I meet with no mention of
  sumptuous Temples before the days of <i>Solomon</i>: new Kingdoms begun
  then to build Sepulchres to their Founders in the form of Sumptuous
  Temples; and such Temples <i>Hiram</i> built in <i>Tyre</i>, <i>Sesac</i>
  in all <i>Egypt</i>, and <i>Benhadad</i> in <i>Damascus</i>.</p>

  <p>For when <i>David</i> <a name="NtA_288"
  href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> smote <i>Hadad Ezer</i> King of
  <i>Zobah</i>, and slew the <i>Syrians</i> of <i>Damascus</i> who came to
  assist him, <i>Rezon</i> <i>the son of </i>Eliadah<i> fled from his lord
  </i>Hadad-Ezer<i>, and gathered men unto him and became Captain over a
  band, and Reigned in </i>Damascus<i>, over </i>Syria: he is called
  <i>Hezion</i>, 1 <i>King.</i> xv. 18. and his successors mentioned in
  history were <i>Tabrimon</i>, <i>Hadad</i> or <i>Ben-hadad</i>,
  <i>Benhadad</i> II. <i>Hazael</i>, <i>Benhadad</i> III. * * and
  <i>Rezin</i> the son of <i>Tabeah</i>. <i>Syria</i> became subject to
  <i>Egypt</i> in the days of <i>Tabrimon</i>, and recovered her liberty
  under <i>Benhadad</i> I; and in the days of <i>Benhadad</i> III, until
  the reign of the last <i>Rezin</i>, they became subject to <i>Israel</i>:
  and in the ninth year of <i>Hoshea</i> King of <i>Judah</i>,
  <i>Tiglath-pileser</i> King of <i>Assyria</i> captivated the
  <i>Syrians</i>, and put an end to their Kingdom: now <i>Josephus</i> <a
  name="NtA_289" href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> tells us, that <i>the
  </i>Syrians<i> 'till his days worshipped both </i>Adar, that is
  <i>Hadad</i> or <i>Benhadad</i>, <i>and his successor </i>Hazael<i> as
  Gods, for their benefactions, and for building Temples by which they
  adorned the city of </i>Damascus<i>: for</i>, saith he, <i>they daily
  celebrate solemnities in honour of these Kings, and boast their
  antiquity, not knowing that they are novel, and lived not above eleven
  hundred years ago</i>. It seems these Kings built sumptuous Sepulchres
  for themselves, and were worshipped therein. <i>Justin</i> <a
  name="NtA_290" href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> calls the first of
  these two Kings <i>Damascus</i>, saying that <i>the city had its name
  from him, and that the </i>Syrians<i> in honour of him worshipped his
  wife </i>Arathes<i> as a Goddess, using her Sepulchre for a
  Temple</i>.</p>

  <p>Another instance we have in the Kingdom of <i>Byblus</i>. In the <a
  name="NtA_291" href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> Reign of <i>Minos</i>
  King of <i>Crete</i>, when <i>Rhadamanthus</i> the brother of
  <i>Minos</i> carried colonies from <i>Crete</i> to the <i>Greek</i>
  islands, and gave the islands to his captains, he gave <i>Lemnos</i> to
  <i>Thoas</i>, or <i>Theias</i>, or <i>Thoantes</i>, the father of
  <i>Hypsipyle</i>, a <i>Cretan</i> worker in metals, and by consequence a
  disciple of the <i>Idæi Dactyli</i>, and perhaps a <i>Ph&#339;nician</i>:
  for the <i>Idæi Dactyli</i>, and <i>Telchines</i>, and <i>Corybantes</i>
  brought their Arts and Sciences from <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>: and <a
  name="NtA_292" href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> <i>Suidas</i> saith,
  that he was descended from <i>Pharnaces</i> King of <i>Cyprus</i>;
  <i>Apollodorus</i>, <a name="NtA_293" href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a>
  that he was the son of <i>Sandochus</i> a <i>Syrian</i>; and
  <i>Apollonius Rhodius</i>, <a name="NtA_294"
  href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> that Hypsipyle<i> gave </i>Jason<i>
  the purple cloak which the </i>Graces<i> made for </i>Bacchus<i>, who
  gave it to his son </i>Thoas, the father of <i>Hypsipyle</i>, and King of
  <i>Lemnos</i>: <i>Thoas</i> married <a name="NtA_295"
  href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> <i>Calycopis</i>, the mother of
  <i>Æneas</i>, and daughter of <i>Otreus</i> King of <i>Phrygia</i>, and
  for his skill on the harp was called <i>Cinyras</i>, and was said to be
  exceedingly beloved by <i>Apollo</i> or <i>Orus</i>: the great
  <i>Bacchus</i> loved his wife, and being caught in bed with her in
  <i>Phrygia</i> appeased him with wine, and composed the matter by making
  him King of <i>Byblus</i> and <i>Cyprus</i>; and then came over the
  <i>Hellespont</i> with his army, and conquered <i>Thrace:</i> and to
  these things the poets allude, in feigning that <i>Vulcan</i> fell from
  heaven into <i>Lemnos</i>, and that <i>Bacchus</i> <a name="NtA_296"
  href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a> appeased him with wine, and reduced
  him back into heaven: he fell from the heaven of the <i>Cretan</i> Gods,
  when he went from <i>Crete</i> to <i>Lemnos</i> to work in metals, and
  was reduced back into heaven when <i>Bacchus</i> made him King of
  <i>Cyprus</i> and <i>Byblus</i>: he Reigned there 'till a very great age,
  living to the times of the <i>Trojan</i> war, and becoming exceeding
  rich: and after the death of his wife <i>Calycopis</i>, <a name="NtA_297"
  href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> he built Temples to her at
  <i>Paphos</i> and <i>Amathus</i>, in <i>Cyprus</i>; and at <i>Byblus</i>
  in <i>Syria</i>, and instituted Priests to her with Sacred Rites and
  lustful <i>Orgia</i>; whence she became the <i>Dea Cypria</i>, and the
  <i>Dea Syria</i>: and from Temples erected to her in these and other
  places, she was also called <i>Paphia</i>, <i>Amathusia</i>,
  <i>Byblia</i>, <i>Cytherea</i> <i>Salaminia</i>, <i>Cnidia</i>,
  <i>Erycina</i>, <i>Idalia</i>. <i>Fama tradit a Cinyra sacratum
  vetustissimum Paphiæ Veneris templum, Deamque ipsam conceptam mari huc
  appulsam</i>: <i>Tacit. Hist.</i> l. 2. c. 3. From her sailing from
  <i>Phrygia</i> to the island <i>Cythera</i>, and from thence to be Queen
  of <i>Cyprus</i>, she was said by the <i>Cyprians</i>, to be born of the
  froth of the sea, and was painted sailing upon a shell. <i>Cinyras</i>
  Deified also his son <i>Gingris</i>, by the name of <i>Adonis</i>; and
  for assisting the <i>Egyptians</i> with armour, it is probable that he
  himself was Deified by his friends the <i>Egyptians</i>, by the name of
  <i>Baal-Canaan</i>, or <i>Vulcan</i>: for <i>Vulcan</i> was celebrated
  principally by the <i>Egyptians</i>, and was a King according to
  <i>Homer</i>, and Reigned in <i>Lemnos</i>; and <i>Cinyras</i> was an
  inventor of arts, <a name="NtA_298" href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a>
  and found out copper in <i>Cyprus</i>, and the smiths hammer, and anvil,
  and tongs, and laver; and imployed workmen in making armour, and other
  things of brass and iron, and was the only King celebrated in history for
  working in metals, and was King of <i>Lemnos</i>, and the husband of
  <i>Venus</i>; all which are the characters of <i>Vulcan</i>: and the
  <i>Egyptians</i> about the time of the death of <i>Cinyras</i>,
  <i>viz.</i> in the Reign of their King <i>Amenophis</i>, built a very
  sumptuous Temple at <i>Memphis</i> to <i>Vulcan</i>, and near it a
  smaller Temple to <i>Venus Hospita</i>; not an <i>Egyptian</i> woman but
  a foreigner, not <i>Helena</i> but <i>Vulcan's Venus</i>: for <a
  name="NtA_299" href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> <i>Herodotus</i> tells
  us, that the region round about this Temple was inhabited by <i>Tyrian
  Ph&#339;nicians</i>, and that <a name="NtA_300"
  href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> <i>Cambyses</i> going into this
  Temple at <i>Memphis</i>, very much derided the statue of <i>Vulcan</i>
  for its littleness; <i>For</i>, saith he, <i>this statue is most like
  those Gods which the </i>Ph&#339;nicians<i> call </i>Patæci<i>, and carry
  about in the fore part of their Ships in the form of Pygmies</i>: and <a
  name="NtA_301" href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> <i>Bochart</i> saith
  of this <i>Venus Hospita</i>, <i>Ph&#339;niciam Venerem in Ægypto pro
  peregrina habitam.</i></p>

  <p>As the <i>Egyptians</i>, <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i> and <i>Syrians</i> in
  those days Deified their Kings and Princes, so upon their coming into
  <i>Asia minor</i> and <i>Greece</i>, they taught those nations to do the
  like, as hath been shewed above. In those days the writing of the
  <i>Thebans</i> and <i>Ethiopians</i> was in hieroglyphicks; and this way
  of writing seems to have spread into the lower <i>Egypt</i> before the
  days of <i>Moses</i>: for thence came the worship of their Gods in the
  various shapes of Birds, Beasts, and Fishes, forbidden in the second
  commandment. Now this emblematical way of writing gave occasion to the
  <i>Thebans</i> and <i>Ethiopians</i>, who in the days of <i>Samuel</i>,
  <i>David</i>, <i>Solomon</i>, and <i>Rehoboam</i> conquered <i>Egypt</i>,
  and the nations round about, and erected a great Empire, to represent and
  signify their conquering Kings and Princes, not by writing down their
  names, but by making various hieroglyphical figures; as by painting
  <i>Ammon</i> with Ram's horns, to signify the King who conquered
  <i>Libya</i>, a country abounding with sheep; his father <i>Amosis</i>
  with a Scithe, to signify that King who conquered the lower <i>Egypt</i>,
  a country abounding with corn; his Son <i>Osiris</i> by an Ox, because he
  taught the conquered nations to plow with oxen; <i>Bacchus</i> with Bulls
  horns for the same reason, and with Grapes because he taught the nations
  to plant vines, and upon a Tiger because he subdued <i>India</i>;
  <i>Orus</i> the son of <i>Osiris</i> with a Harp, to signify the Prince
  who was eminently skilled on that instrument; <i>Jupiter</i> upon an
  Eagle to signify the sublimity of his dominion, and with a Thunderbolt to
  represent him a warrior; <i>Venus</i> in a Chariot drawn with two Doves,
  to represent her amorous and lustful; <i>Neptune</i> with a Trident, to
  signify the commander of a fleet composed of three Squadrons;
  <i>Ægeon</i>, a Giant, with 50 heads, and an hundred hands, to signify
  <i>Neptune</i> with his men in a ship of fifty oars; <i>Thoth</i> with a
  Dog's head and wings at his cap and feet, and a <i>Caduceus</i> writhen
  about with two Serpents, to signify a man of craft, and an embassador who
  reconciled two contending nations; <i>Pan</i> with a Pipe and the legs of
  a Goat, to signify a man delighted in piping and dancing; and
  <i>Hercules</i> with Pillars and a Club, because <i>Sesostris</i> set up
  pillars in all his conquests, and fought against the <i>Libyans</i> with
  clubs: this is that <i>Hercules</i> who, according to <a name="NtA_302"
  href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> <i>Eudoxus</i>, was slain by
  <i>Typhon</i>; and according to <i>Ptolomæus Hephæstion</i> <a
  name="NtA_303" href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a> was called
  <i>Nilus</i>, and who conquered <i>Geryon</i> with his three sons in
  <i>Spain</i>, and set up the famous pillars at the mouth of the
  <i>Straits</i>: for <i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_304"
  href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> mentioning three <i>Hercules</i>'s,
  the <i>Egyptian</i>, the <i>Tyrian</i>, and the son of <i>Alcmena</i>,
  saith that <i>the oldest flourished among the </i>Egyptians<i>, and
  having conquered a great part of the world, set up the pillars in
  </i>Afric: and <i>Vasæus</i>, <a name="NtA_305"
  href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> that <i>Osiris</i>, called also
  <i>Dionysius</i>, <i>came into </i>Spain<i> and conquered </i>Geryon<i>,
  and was the first who brought Idolatry into </i>Spain. <i>Strabo</i> <a

  <i>Ethiopians</i> called <i>Megabars</i> fought with clubs: and some of
  the <i>Greeks</i> <a name="NtA_307" href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a>
  did so 'till the times of the <i>Trojan</i> war. Now from this
  hieroglyphical way of writing it came to pass, that upon the division of
  <i>Egypt</i> into <i>Nomes</i> by <i>Sesostris</i>, the great men of the
  Kingdom to whom the <i>Nomes</i> were dedicated, were represented in
  their Sepulchers or Temples of the <i>Nomes</i>, by various
  hieroglyphicks; as by an <i>Ox</i>, a <i>Cat</i>, a <i>Dog</i>, a
  <i>Cebus</i>, a <i>Goat</i>, a <i>Lyon</i>, a <i>Scarabæus</i>, an
  <i>Ichneumon</i>, a <i>Crocodile</i>, an <i>Hippopotamus</i>, an
  <i>Oxyrinchus</i>, an <i>Ibis</i>, a <i>Crow</i>, a <i>Hawk,</i> a
  <i>Leek</i>, and were worshipped by the <i>Nomes</i> in the shape of
  these creatures.</p>

  <p>The <a name="NtA_308" href="#Nt_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a>
  <i>Atlantides</i>, a people upon mount <i>Atlas</i> conquered by the
  <i>Egyptians</i> in the Reign of <i>Ammon</i>, related that <i>Uranus</i>
  was their first King, and reduced them from a savage course of life, and
  caused them to dwell in towns and cities, and lay up and use the fruits
  of the earth, and that he reigned over a great part of the world, and by
  his wife <i>Titæa</i> had eighteen children, among which were
  <i>Hyperion</i> and <i>Basilea</i> the parents of <i>Helius</i> and
  <i>Selene</i>; that the brothers of <i>Hyperion</i> slew him, and drowned
  his son <i>Helius</i>, the <i>Phaeton</i> of the ancients, in the
  <i>Nile</i>, and divided his Kingdom amongst themselves; and the country
  bordering upon the Ocean fell to the lot of <i>Atlas</i>, from whom the
  people were called <i>Atlantides</i>. By <i>Uranus</i> or <i>Jupiter
  Uranius</i>, <i>Hyperion</i>, <i>Basilea</i>, <i>Helius</i> and
  <i>Selene</i>, I understand <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>, <i>Osiris</i>,
  <i>Isis</i>, <i>Orus</i> and <i>Bubaste</i>; and by the sharing of the
  Kingdom of <i>Hyperion</i> amongst his brothers the <i>Titans</i>, I
  understand the division of the earth among the Gods mentioned in the Poem
  of <i>Solon</i>.</p>

  <p>For <i>Solon</i> having travelled into <i>Egypt</i>, and conversed
  with the Priests of <i>Sais</i>; about their antiquities, wrote a Poem of
  what he had learnt, but did not finish it; <a name="NtA_309"
  href="#Nt_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> and this Poem fell into the hands of
  <i>Plato</i> who relates out of it, that at the mouth of the
  <i>Straits</i> near <i>Hercules</i>'s Pillars there was an Island called
  <i>Atlantis</i>, the people of which, nine thousand years before the days
  of <i>Solon</i>, reigned over <i>Libya</i> as far as <i>Egypt</i>; and
  over <i>Europe</i> as far as the <i>Tyrrhene</i> sea; and all this force
  collected into one body invaded <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Greece</i>, and
  whatever was contained within the Pillars of <i>Hercules</i>, but was
  resisted and stopt by the <i>Athenians</i> and other <i>Greeks</i>, and
  thereby the rest of the nations not yet conquered were preserved: he
  saith also that in those days the Gods, having finished their conquests,
  divided the whole earth amongst themselves, partly into larger, partly
  into smaller portions, and instituted Temples and Sacred Rites to
  themselves; and that the Island <i>Atlantis</i> fell to the lot of
  <i>Neptune</i>, who made his eldest Son <i>Atlas</i> King of the whole
  Island, a part of which was called <i>Gadir</i>; and that <i>in the
  history of the said wars mention was made of </i>Cecrops<i>,
  </i>Erechtheus<i>, </i>Erichthonius<i>, and others before </i>Theseus<i>,
  and also of the women who warred with the men, and of the habit and
  statue of </i>Minerva<i>, the study of war in those days being common to
  men and women</i>. By all these circumstances it is manifest that these
  Gods were the <i>Dii magni majorum gentium</i>, and lived between the age
  of <i>Cecrops</i> and <i>Theseus</i>; and that the wars which
  <i>Sesostris</i> with his brother <i>Neptune</i> made upon the nations by
  land and sea, and the resistance he met with in <i>Greece</i>, and the
  following invasion of <i>Egypt</i> by <i>Neptune</i>, are here described;
  and how the captains of <i>Sesostris</i> shared his conquests amongst
  themselves, as the captains of <i>Alexander</i> the great did his
  conquests long after, and instituting Temples and Priests and sacred
  Rites to themselves, caused the nations to worship them after death as
  Gods: and that the Island <i>Gadir</i> or <i>Gades</i>, with all
  <i>Libya</i>, fell to the lot of him who after death was Deified by the
  name of <i>Neptune</i>. The time therefore when these things were done is
  by <i>Solon</i> limited to the age of <i>Neptune</i>, the father of
  <i>Atlas</i>; for <i>Homer</i> tells us, that <i>Ulysses</i> presently
  after the <i>Trojan</i> war found <i>Calypso</i> the daughter of
  <i>Atlas</i> in the <i>Ogygian</i> Island, perhaps <i>Gadir</i>; and
  therefore it was but two Generations before the <i>Trojan</i> war. This
  is that <i>Neptune</i>, who with <i>Apollo</i> or <i>Orus</i> fortified
  <i>Troy</i> with a wall, in the Reign of <i>Laomedon</i> the father of
  <i>Priamus</i>, and left many natural children in <i>Greece</i>, some of
  which were <i>Argonauts</i>, and others were contemporary to the
  <i>Argonauts</i>; and therefore he flourished but one Generation before
  the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition, and by consequence about 400 years
  before <i>Solon</i> went into <i>Egypt</i>: but the Priests of
  <i>Egypt</i> in those 400 years had magnified the stories and antiquity
  of their Gods so exceedingly, as to make them nine thousand years older
  than <i>Solon</i>, and the Island <i>Atlantis</i> bigger than all
  <i>Afric</i> and <i>Asia</i> together, and full of people; and because in
  the days of <i>Solon</i> this great Island did not appear, they pretended
  that it was sunk into the sea with all its people: thus great was the
  vanity of the Priests of <i>Egypt</i> in magnifying their
  antiquities.</p>

  <p>The <i>Cretans</i> <a name="NtA_310"
  href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> affirmed that <i>Neptune was the man
  who set out a fleet, having obtained this Præfecture of </i>his father<i>
  Saturn; whence posterity reckoned things done in the sea to be under his
  government, and mariners honoured him with sacrifices</i>: the invention
  of tall Ships with sails <a name="NtA_311"
  href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> is also ascribed to him. He was first
  worshipped in <i>Africa</i>, as <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_312"
  href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> affirms, and therefore Reigned over
  that province: for his eldest son <i>Atlas</i>, who succeeded him, was
  not only Lord of the Island <i>Atlantis</i>, but also Reigned over a
  great part of <i>Afric</i>, giving his name to the people called
  <i>Atlantii</i>, and to the mountain <i>Atlas</i>, and the <i>Atlantic
  Ocean</i>. The <a name="NtA_313" href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a>
  outmost parts of the earth and promontories, and whatever bordered upon
  the sea and was washed by it, the <i>Egyptians</i> called <i>Neptys</i>;
  and on the coasts of <i>Marmorica</i> and <i>Cyrene</i>, <i>Bochart</i>
  and <i>Arius Montanus</i> place the <i>Naphthuhim</i>, a people sprung
  from <i>Mizraim</i>, <i>Gen.</i> x. 13; and thence <i>Neptune</i> and his
  wife <i>Neptys</i> might have their names, the words <i>Neptune</i>,
  <i>Neptys</i> and <i>Naphthuhim</i>, signifying the King, Queen, and
  people of the sea-coasts. The <i>Greeks</i> tell us that <i>Japetus</i>
  was the father of <i>Atlas</i>, and <i>Bochart</i> derives <i>Japetus</i>
  and <i>Neptune</i> from the same original: he and his son <i>Atlas</i>
  are celebrated in the ancient fables for making war upon the Gods of
  <i>Egypt</i>; as when <i>Lucian</i> <a name="NtA_314"
  href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a> saith that <i>Corinth</i> being full
  of fables, tells the fight of <i>Sol</i> and <i>Neptune</i>, that is, of
  <i>Apollo</i> and <i>Python</i>, or <i>Orus</i> and <i>Typhon</i>; and
  where <i>Agatharcides</i> <a name="NtA_315"
  href="#Nt_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> relates how the Gods of <i>Egypt</i>
  fled from the Giants, 'till the <i>Titans</i> came in and saved them by
  putting <i>Neptune</i> to flight; and where <i>Hyginus</i> <a
  name="NtA_316" href="#Nt_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> tells the war between
  the Gods of <i>Ægypt</i>, and the <i>Titans</i> commanded by
  <i>Atlas</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Titans</i> are the posterity of <i>Titæa</i>, some of whom
  under <i>Hercules</i> assisted the Gods, others under <i>Neptune</i> and
  <i>Atlas</i> warred against them: <i>for which reason</i>, saith
  <i>Plutarch</i>, <a name="NtA_317" href="#Nt_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a>
  <i>the Priests of </i>Egypt<i> abominated the sea, and had </i>Neptune<i>
  in no honour</i>. By <i>Hercules</i>, I understand here the general of
  the forces of <i>Thebais</i> and <i>Ethiopia</i> whom the Gods or great
  men of <i>Egypt</i> called to their assistance, against the Giants or
  great men of <i>Libya</i>, who had slain <i>Osiris</i> and invaded
  <i>Egypt</i>: for <i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_318"
  href="#Nt_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> saith that <i>when </i>Osiris<i> made
  his expedition over the world, he left his kinsman </i>Hercules<i>
  general of his forces over all his dominions, and </i>Antæus<i> governor
  of </i>Libya<i> and </i>Ethiopia. <i>Antæus</i> Reigned over all
  <i>Afric</i> to the <i>Atlantic Ocean</i>, and built <i>Tingis</i> or
  <i>Tangieres</i>: <i>Pindar</i> <a name="NtA_319"
  href="#Nt_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> tells us that he Reigned at
  <i>Irasa</i> a town of <i>Libya</i>, where <i>Cyrene</i> was afterwards
  built: he invaded <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Thebais</i>; for he was beaten by
  <i>Hercules</i> and the <i>Egyptians</i> near <i>Antæa</i> or
  <i>Antæopolis</i>, a town of <i>Thebais</i>; and <i>Diodorus</i> <a
  name="NtA_320" href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> tells us that <i>this
  town had its name from </i>Antæus<i>, whom </i>Hercules<i> slew in the
  days of </i>Osiris. <i>Hercules</i> overthrew him several times, and
  every time he grew stronger by recruits from <i>Libya</i>, his mother
  earth; but <i>Hercules</i> intercepted his recruits, and at length slew
  him. In these wars <i>Hercules</i> took the <i>Libyan</i> world from
  <i>Atlas</i>, and made <i>Atlas</i> pay tribute out of his golden
  orchard, the Kingdom of <i>Afric</i>. <i>Antæus</i> and <i>Atlas</i> were
  both of them sons of <i>Neptune</i> both of them Reigned over all
  <i>Libya</i> and <i>Afric</i>, between <i>Mount Atlas</i> and the
  <i>Mediterranean</i> to the very Ocean; both of them invaded
  <i>Egypt</i>, and contended with <i>Hercules</i> in the wars of the Gods,
  and therefore they are but two names of one and the same man; and even
  the name <i>Atlas</i> in the oblique cases seems to have been compounded
  of the name <i>Antæeus</i> and some other word, perhaps the word
  <i>Atal</i>, cursed, put before it: the invasion of <i>Egypt</i> by
  <i>Antæus</i>, <i>Ovid</i> hath relation unto, where he makes
  <i>Hercules</i> say,</p>

  <p>This war was at length composed by the intervention of <i>Mercury</i>,
  who in memory thereof was said to reconcile two contending serpents, by
  casting his Ambassador's rod between them: and thus much concerning the
  ancient state of <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Libya</i>, and <i>Greece</i>, described
  by <i>Solon</i>.</p>

  <p>The mythology of the <i>Cretans</i> differed in some things from that
  of <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Libya</i>: for in the <i>Cretan</i> mythology,
  <i>C&#339;lus</i> and <i>Terra</i>, or <i>Uranus</i> and <i>Titæa</i>
  were the parents of <i>Saturn</i> and <i>Rhea</i>, and <i>Saturn</i> and
  <i>Rhea</i> were the parents of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Juno</i>; and
  <i>Hyperion</i>, <i>Japetus</i> and the <i>Titans</i> were one Generation
  older than <i>Jupiter</i>; and <i>Saturn</i> was expelled his Kingdom and
  castrated by his son <i>Jupiter</i>: which fable hath no place in the
  mythology of <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

  <p>During the Reign of <i>Sesac</i>, <i>Jeroboam</i> being in subjection
  to <i>Egypt</i>; set up the Gods of <i>Egypt</i> in <i>Dan</i> and
  <i>Bethel</i>; and <i>Israel was without the true God, and without a
  teaching Priest and without law: and in those times there was no peace to
  him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon
  all the inhabitants of the countries; and nation was destroyed of nation,
  and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity</i>. 2
  <i>Chron</i>. xv. 3, 5, 6. But in the fifth year of <i>Asa</i> the land
  of <i>Judah</i> became quiet from war, and from thence had quiet ten
  years; and <i>Asa</i> took away the altars of strange Gods, and brake
  down the Images, and built the fenced cities of <i>Judah</i> with walls
  and towers and gates and bars, having rest on every side, and got up an
  army of 580000 men, with which in the fifteenth year of his Reign he met
  <i>Zerah</i> the <i>Ethiopian</i>, who came out against him with an army
  of a thousand thousand <i>Ethiopians</i> and <i>Libyans</i>: the way of
  the <i>Libyans</i> was through <i>Egypt</i>, and therefore <i>Zerah</i>
  was now Lord of <i>Egypt</i>: they fought at <i>Mareshah</i> near
  <i>Gerar</i>, between <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Judæa</i>, and <i>Zerah</i> was
  beaten, so that he could not recover himself: and from all this I seem to
  gather that <i>Osiris</i> was slain in the fifth year of <i>Asa</i>, and
  thereupon <i>Egypt</i> fell into civil wars, being invaded by the
  <i>Libyans</i>, and defended by the <i>Ethiopians</i> for a time; and
  after ten years more being invaded by the <i>Ethiopians</i>, who slew
  <i>Orus</i> the son and successor of <i>Osiris</i>, drowning him in the
  <i>Nile</i>, and seized his Kingdom. By these civil wars of <i>Egypt</i>,
  the land of <i>Judah</i> had rest ten years. <i>Osiris</i> or
  <i>Sesostris</i> reigned long, <i>Manetho</i> saith 48 years; and by this
  reckoning he began to Reign about the 17th year of <i>Solomon</i>; and
  <i>Orus</i> his son was drowned in the 15th year of <i>Asa</i>: for
  <i>Pliny</i> <a name="NtA_321" href="#Nt_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> tells
  us, <i>Ægyptiorum bellis attrita est Æthiopia, vicissim imperitando
  serviendoque, clara &amp; potens etiam usque ad Trojana bella Memnone
  regnante</i>. <i>Ethiopia</i>, served <i>Egypt</i> 'till the death of
  <i>Sesostris</i>, and no longer; for <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_322"
  href="#Nt_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a> tells us that <i>he alone enjoyed the
  Empire of </i>Ethiopia: then the <i>Ethiopians</i> became free, and after
  ten years became Lords of <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Libya</i>, under
  <i>Zerah</i> and <i>Amenophis</i>.</p>

  <p>When <i>Asa</i> by his victory over <i>Zerah</i> became safe from
  <i>Egypt</i>, he assembled all the people, and they offered sacrifices
  out of the spoils, and entered into a covenant upon oath to seek the
  Lord; and in lieu of the vessels taken away by <i>Sesac</i>, <i>he
  brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated,
  and that he himself had dedicated, Silver and Gold, and Vessels</i>. 2
  <i>Chron.</i> xv.</p>

  <p>When <i>Zerah</i> was beaten, so that he could not recover himself,
  the people <a name="NtA_323" href="#Nt_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> of the
  lower <i>Egypt</i> revolted from the <i>Ethiopians</i>, and called in to
  their assistance two hundred thousand <i>Jews</i> and <i>Canaanites</i>;
  and under the conduct of one <i>Osarsiphus</i>, a Priest of <i>Egypt</i>,
  called <i>Usorthon</i>, <i>Osorchon</i>, <i>Osorchor</i>, and <i>Hercules
  Ægyptius</i> by <i>Manetho</i>, caused the <i>Ethiopians</i> now under
  <i>Memnon</i> to retire to <i>Memphis</i>: and there <i>Memnon</i> turned
  the river <i>Nile</i> into a new channel, built a bridge over it and
  fortified that pass, and then went back into <i>Ethiopia</i>: but after
  thirteen years, he and his young son <i>Ramesses</i> came down with an
  army from <i>Ethiopia</i>, conquered the lower <i>Egypt</i>, and drove
  out the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>; and this action the
  <i>Egyptian</i> writers and their followers call the second expulsion of
  the Shepherds, taking <i>Osarsiphus</i> for <i>Moses</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Tithonus</i> a beautiful youth, the elder brother of
  <i>Priamus</i>, went into <i>Ethiopia</i>, being carried thither among
  many captives by <i>Sesostris</i>: and the <i>Greeks</i>, before the days
  of <i>Hesiod</i>, feigned that <i>Memnon</i> was his son: <i>Memnon</i>
  therefore, in the opinion of those ancient <i>Greeks</i>, was one
  Generation younger than <i>Tithonus</i>, and was born after the return of
  <i>Sesostris</i> into <i>Egypt</i>: suppose about 16 or 20 years after
  the death of <i>Solomon</i>. He is said to have lived very long, and so
  might die about 95 years after <i>Solomon</i>, as we reckoned above: his
  mother, called <i>Cissia</i> by <i>Æschylus</i>, in a statue erected to
  her in <i>Egypt</i>, <a name="NtA_324"
  href="#Nt_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a> was represented as the daughter, the
  wife, and the mother of a King, and therefore he was the son of a King;
  which makes it probable that <i>Zerah</i>, whom he succeeded in the
  Kingdom of <i>Ethiopia</i>, was his father.</p>

  <p>Historians <a name="NtA_325" href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> agree
  that <i>Menes</i> Reigned in <i>Egypt</i> next after the Gods, and turned
  the river into a new channel, and built a bridge over it, and built
  <i>Memphis</i> and the magnificent Temple of <i>Vulcan</i>: he built
  <i>Memphis</i> over-against the place where <i>Grand Cairo</i> now
  stands, called by the <i>Arabian</i> historians <i>Mesir</i>: he built
  only the body of the Temple of <i>Vulcan</i>, and his successors
  <i>Ramesses</i> or <i>Rhampsinitus</i>, <i>M&#339;ris</i>,
  <i>Asychis</i>, and <i>Psammiticus</i> built the western, northern
  eastern, and southern portico's thereof: <i>Psammiticus</i>, who built
  the last portico of this Temple, Reigned three hundred years after the
  victory of <i>Asa</i> over <i>Zerah</i>, and it is not likely that this
  Temple could be above three hundred years in building, or that any
  <i>Menes</i> could be King of all <i>Egypt</i> before the expulsion of
  the Shepherds. The last of the Gods of <i>Egypt</i> was <i>Orus</i>, with
  his mother <i>Isis</i>, and sister <i>Bubaste</i>, and secretary
  <i>Thoth</i>, and unkle <i>Typhon</i>; and the King who reigned next
  after all their deaths, and turned the river and built a bridge over it,
  and built <i>Memphis</i> and the Temple of <i>Vulcan</i>, was
  <i>Memnon</i> or <i>Amenophis</i>, called by the <i>Egyptians</i>
  <i>Amenoph</i>; and therefore he is <i>Menes</i>: for the names
  <i>Amenoph</i>, or <i>Menoph</i>, and <i>Menes</i> do not much differ;
  and from <i>Amenoph</i> the city <i>Memphis</i> built by <i>Menes</i> had
  its <i>Egyptian</i> names <i>Moph</i>, <i>Noph</i>, <i>Menoph</i> or
  <i>Menuf</i>, as it is still called by the <i>Arabian</i> historians: the
  necessity of fortifying this place against <i>Osarsiphus</i> gave
  occasion to the building of it.</p>

  <p>In the time of the revolt of the lower <i>Egypt</i> under
  <i>Osarsiphus</i>, and the retirement of <i>Amenophis</i> into
  <i>Ethiopia</i>, <i>Egypt</i> being then in the greatest distraction, the
  <i>Greeks</i> built the ship <i>Argo</i>, and sent in it the flower of
  <i>Greece</i> to <i>Æetes</i> in <i>Colchis</i>, and to many other
  Princes on the coasts of the <i>Euxine</i> and <i>Mediterranean</i> seas;
  and this ship was built after the pattern of an <i>Egyptian</i> ship with
  fifty oars, in which <i>Danaus</i> with his fifty daughters a few years
  before fled from <i>Egypt</i> into <i>Greece</i>, and was the first long
  ship with sails built by the <i>Greeks</i>: and such an improvement of
  navigation, with a design to send the flower of <i>Greece</i> to many
  Princes upon the sea-coasts of the <i>Euxine</i> and <i>Mediterranean</i>
  seas, was too great an undertaking to be set on foot, without the
  concurrence of the Princes and States of <i>Greece</i>, and perhaps the
  approbation of the <i>Amphictyonic</i> Council; for it was done by the
  dictate of the Oracle. This Council met every half year upon
  state-affairs for the welfare of <i>Greece</i>, and therefore knew of
  this expedition, and might send the <i>Argonauts</i> upon an embassy to
  the said Princes; and for concealing their design might make the fable of
  the golden fleece, in relation to the ship of <i>Phrixus</i> whose ensign
  was a golden ram: and probably their design was to notify the distraction
  of <i>Egypt</i>, and the invasion thereof by the <i>Ethiopians</i> and
  <i>Israelites</i>, to the said Princes, and to persuade them to take that
  opportunity to revolt from <i>Egypt</i>, and set up for themselves, and
  make a league with the <i>Greeks</i>: for the <i>Argonauts</i> went
  through <a name="NtA_326" href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a> the Kingdom
  of <i>Colchis</i> by land to the <i>Armenians</i>, and through
  <i>Armenia</i> to the <i>Medes</i>; which could not have been done if
  they had not made friendship with the nations through which they passed:
  they visited also <i>Laomedon</i> King of the <i>Trojans</i>,
  <i>Phineus</i> King of the <i>Thracians</i>, <i>Cyzicus</i> King of the
  <i>Doliones</i>, <i>Lycus</i> King of the <i>Mariandyni</i>, the coasts
  of <i>Mysia</i> and <i>Taurica Chersonesus</i>, the nations upon the
  <i>Tanais</i>, the people about <i>Byzantium</i>, and the coasts of
  <i>Epirus</i>, <i>Corsica</i>, <i>Melita</i>, <i>Italy</i>,
  <i>Sicily</i>, <i>Sardinia</i>, and <i>Gallia</i> upon the
  <i>Mediterranean</i>; and from thence they <a name="NtA_327"
  href="#Nt_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> crossed the sea to <i>Afric</i>, and
  there conferred with <i>Euripylus</i> King of <i>Cyrene</i>: and <a
  name="NtA_328" href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> <i>Strabo</i> tells us
  that <i>in </i>Armenia<i> and </i>Media<i>, and the neighbouring places,
  there were frequent monuments of the expedition of </i>Jason<i>; as also
  about </i>Sinope<i>, and its sea-coasts, the </i>Propontis<i> and the
  </i>Hellespont<i>, and in the </i>Mediterranean: and a message by the
  flower of <i>Greece</i> to so many nations could be on no other account
  than state-policy; these nations had been invaded by the
  <i>Egyptians</i>, but after this expedition we hear no more of their
  continuing in subjection to <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

  <p>The <a name="NtA_329" href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a>
  <i>Egyptians</i> originally lived on the fruits of the earth, and fared
  hardly, and abstained from animals, and therefore abominated Shepherds:
  <i>Menes</i> taught them to adorn their beds and tables with rich
  furniture and carpets, and brought in amongst them a sumptuous, delicious
  and voluptuous way of life: and about a hundred years after his death,
  <i>Gnephacthus</i> one of his successors cursed him for it, and to reduce
  the luxury of <i>Egypt</i>, caused the curse to be entered in the Temple
  of <i>Jupiter</i> at <i>Thebes</i>; and by this curse the honour of
  <i>Menes</i> was diminished among the <i>Egyptians</i>.</p>

  <p>The Kings of <i>Egypt</i> who expelled the Shepherds and Succeeded
  them, Reigned I think first at <i>Coptos</i>, and then at <i>Thebes</i>,
  and then at <i>Memphis</i>. At <i>Coptos</i> I place
  <i>Misphragmuthosis</i> and <i>Amosis</i> or <i>Thomosis</i> who expelled
  the Shepherds, and abolished their custom of sacrificing men, and
  extended the <i>Coptic</i> language, and the name of <span lang="el"

  the conquest. Then <i>Thebes</i> became the Royal City of <i>Ammon</i>,
  and from him was called <i>No-Ammon,</i> and his conquest on the west of
  <i>Egypt</i> was called <i>Ammonia.</i> After him, in the same city of
  <i>Thebes</i>, Reigned <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Orus</i>, <i>Menes</i> or
  <i>Amenophis</i>, and <i>Ramesses</i>: but <i>Memphis</i> and her
  miracles were not yet celebrated in <i>Greece</i>; for <i>Homer</i>
  celebrates <i>Thebes</i> as in its glory in his days, and makes no
  mention of <i>Memphis</i>. After <i>Menes</i> had built <i>Memphis,
  M&#339;ris</i> the successor of <i>Ramesses</i> adorned it, and made it
  the seat of the Kingdom, and this was almost two Generations after the
  <i>Trojan</i> war. <i>Cinyras</i>, the <i>Vulcan</i> who married
  <i>Venus</i>, and under the Kings of <i>Egypt</i> Reigned over
  <i>Cyprus</i> and part of <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, and made armour for those
  Kings, lived 'till the times of the <i>Trojan</i> war: and upon his death
  <i>Menes</i> or <i>Memnon</i> might Deify him, and found the famous
  Temple of <i>Vulcan</i> in that city for his worship, but not live to
  finish it. In a plain <a name="NtA_330"
  href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> not far from <i>Memphis</i> are many
  small Pyramids, said to be built by <i>Venephes</i> or <i>Enephes</i>;
  and I suspect that <i>Venephes</i> and <i>Enephes</i> have been corruptly
  written for <i>Menephes</i> or <i>Amenophis</i>, the letters <i>AM</i>
  being almost worn out in some old manuscript: for after the example of
  these Pyramids, the following Kings, <i>M&#339;ris</i> and his
  successors, built others much larger. The plain in which they were built
  was the burying-place of that city, as appears by the Mummies there
  found; and therefore the Pyramids were the sepulchral monuments of the
  Kings and Princes of that city: and by these and such like works the city
  grew famous soon after the days of <i>Homer</i>; who therefore flourished
  in the Reign of <i>Ramesses</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_331" href="#Nt_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a>
  is the oldest historian now extant who wrote of the antiquities of
  <i>Egypt</i>, and had what he wrote from the Priests of that country: and
  <i>Diodorus</i>, who wrote almost 400 years after him, and had his
  relations also from the Priests of <i>Egypt</i>, placed many nameless
  Kings between those whom <i>Herodotus</i> placed in continual succession.
  The Priests of <i>Egypt</i> had therefore, between the days of
  <i>Herodotus</i> and <i>Diodorus</i>, out of vanity, very much increased
  the number of their Kings: and what they did after the days of
  <i>Herodotus</i>, they began to do before his days; for he tells us that
  they recited to him out of their books, the names of 330 Kings who
  Reigned after <i>Menes</i>, but did nothing memorable, except
  <i>Nitocris</i> and <i>M&#339;ris</i> the last of them: all these Reigned
  at <i>Thebes</i>, 'till <i>M&#339;ris</i> translated the seat of the
  Empire from <i>Thebes</i> to <i>Memphis</i>. After <i>M&#339;ris</i> he
  reckons <i>Sesostris</i>, <i>Pheron</i>, <i>Proteus</i>,
  <i>Rhampsinitus</i>, <i>Cheops</i>, <i>Cephren</i>, <i>Mycerinus</i>,
  <i>Asychis</i>, <i>Anysis</i>, <i>Sabacon</i>, <i>Anysis</i> again,
  <i>Sethon</i>, twelve contemporary Kings, <i>Psammitichus</i>,
  <i>Nechus</i>, <i>Psammis</i>, <i>Apries</i>, <i>Amasis</i>, and
  <i>Psammenitus</i>. The <i>Egyptians</i> had before the days of
  <i>Solon</i> made their monarchy 9000 years old, and now they reckon'd to
  <i>Herodotus</i> a succession of 330 Kings Reigning so many Generations,
  that is about 11000 years, before <i>Sesostris</i>: but the Kings who
  Reigned long before <i>Sesostris</i> might Reign over several little
  Kingdoms in several parts of <i>Egypt</i>, before the rise of their
  Monarchy; and by consequence before the days of <i>Eli</i> and
  <i>Samuel</i>, and so are not under our consideration: and these names
  may have been multiplied by corruption; and some of them, as
  <i>Athothes</i> or <i>Thoth</i>, the secretary of <i>Osiris</i>;
  <i>Tosorthrus</i> or <i>Æsculapius</i> a Physician who invented building
  with square stones; and <i>Thuor</i> or <i>Polybus</i> the husband of
  <i>Alcandra</i>, were only Princes of <i>Egypt</i>. If with
  <i>Herodotus</i> we omit the names of those Kings who did nothing
  memorable, and consider only those whose actions are recorded, and who
  left splendid monuments of their having Reigned over <i>Egypt</i>, such
  as were Temples, Statues, Pyramids, Obelisks, and Palaces dedicated or
  ascribed to them, these Kings reduced into good order will give us all or
  almost all the Kings of <i>Egypt</i>, from the days of the expulsion of
  the Shepherds and founding of the Monarchy, downwards to the conquest of
  <i>Egypt</i> by <i>Cambyses</i>: for <i>Sesostris</i> Reigned in the Age
  of the Gods of <i>Egypt</i>: being Deified by the names of <i>Osiris</i>,
  <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Bacchus</i>, as above; and therefore <i>Menes</i>,
  <i>Nitocris</i>, and <i>M&#339;ris</i> are to be placed after him;
  <i>Menes</i> and his son <i>Ramesses</i> Reigned next after the Gods, and
  therefore <i>Nitocris</i> and <i>M&#339;ris</i> Reigned after
  <i>Ramesses</i>: <i>M&#339;ris</i> is set down immediately before
  <i>Cheops</i>, three times in the Dynastys of the Kings of <i>Egypt</i>
  composed by <i>Eratosthenes</i>, and once in the Dynasties of
  <i>Manetho</i>; and in the same Dynasties <i>Nitocris</i> is set after
  the builders of the three great Pyramids, and according to
  <i>Herodotus</i> her brother Reigned before her, and was slain, and she
  revenged his death; and according to <i>Syncellus</i> she built the third
  great Pyramid; and the builders of the Pyramids Reigned at
  <i>Memphis</i>, and by consequence after <i>M&#339;ris</i>. Now from
  these things I gather that the Kings of <i>Egypt</i> mentioned by
  <i>Herodotus</i> ought to be placed in this order; <i>Sesostris</i>,
  <i>Pheron</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Menes</i>, <i>Rhampsinitus</i>,
  <i>M&#339;ris</i>, <i>Cheops</i>, <i>Cephren</i>, <i>Mycerinus</i>,
  <i>Nitocris</i>, <i>Asychis</i>, <i>Anysis</i>, <i>Sabacon</i>,
  <i>Anysis</i> again, <i>Sethon</i>, twelve contemporary Kings,
  <i>Psammitichus</i>, <i>Nechus</i>, <i>Psammis</i>, <i>Apries</i>,
  <i>Amasis</i>, <i>Psammenitus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Pheron</i> is by <i>Herodotus</i> said to be the son and successor
  of <i>Sesostris</i>. He was Deified by the name of <i>Orus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Proteus</i> Reigned in the lower <i>Egypt</i> when <i>Paris</i>
  sailed thither; that is at the end of the <i>Trojan</i> war, according to
  <a name="NtA_332" href="#Nt_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> <i>Herodotus</i>:
  and at that time <i>Amenophis</i> was King of <i>Egypt</i> and
  <i>Ethiopia</i>: but in his absence <i>Proteus</i> might be governor of
  some part of the lower <i>Egypt</i> under him; for <i>Homer</i> places
  <i>Proteus</i> upon the sea-coasts, and makes him a sea God, and calls
  him the servant of <i>Neptune</i>; and <i>Herodotus</i> saith that he
  rose up from among the common people, and that <i>Proteus</i> was his
  name translated into <i>Greek</i>, and this name in <i>Greek</i>
  signifies only a Prince or President. He succeeded <i>Pheron</i>, and was
  succeeded by <i>Rhampsinitus</i> according to <i>Herodotus</i>; and so
  was contemporary to <i>Amenophis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Amenophis</i> Reigned next after <i>Orus</i> and <i>Isis</i> the
  last of the Gods; he Reigned at first over all <i>Egypt</i>, and then
  over <i>Memphis</i> and the upper parts of <i>Egypt</i>; and by
  conquering <i>Osarsiphus</i>, who had revolted from him, became King of
  all <i>Egypt</i> again, about 51 years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>.
  He built <i>Memphis</i> and ordered the worship of the Gods of
  <i>Egypt</i>, and built a Palace at <i>Abydus</i>, and the
  <i>Memnonia</i> at <i>This</i> and <i>Susa</i>, and the magnificent
  Temple of <i>Vulcan</i> in <i>Memphis</i>; the building with square
  stones being found out before by <i>Tosorthrus</i>, the <i>Æsculapius</i>
  of <i>Egypt</i>: he is by corruption of his name called <i>Menes</i>,
  <i>Mines</i>, <i>Minæus</i>, <i>Mineus</i>, <i>Minies</i>, <i>Mnevis</i>,
  <i>Enephes</i>, <i>Venephes</i>, <i>Phamenophis</i>, <i>Osymanthyas</i>,
  <i>Osimandes</i>, <i>Ismandes</i>, <i>Imandes</i>, <i>Memnon</i>,
  <i>Arminon.</i></p>

  <p><i>Amenophis</i> was succeeded by his son, called by <i>Herodotus</i>,
  <i>Rhampsinitus</i>, and by others <i>Ramses</i>, <i>Ramises</i>,
  <i>Rameses</i>, <i>Ramesses</i>, <a name="NtA_333"
  href="#Nt_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> <i>Ramestes</i>, <i>Rhampses</i>,
  <i>Remphis</i>. Upon an Obelisk erected by this King in
  <i>Heliopolis</i>, and sent to <i>Rome</i> by the Emperor
  <i>Constantius</i>, was an inscription, interpreted by <i>Hermapion</i>
  an <i>Egyptian</i> Priest, expressing that the King was long lived, and
  Reigned over a great part of the earth: and <i>Strabo</i>, <a
  name="NtA_334" href="#Nt_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> an eye-witness, tells
  us, that in the monuments of the Kings of <i>Egypt</i>, above the
  <i>Memnonium</i> were inscriptions upon Obelisks, expressing the riches
  of the Kings, and their Reigning as far as <i>Scythia</i>,
  <i>Bactria</i>, <i>India</i> and <i>Ionia</i>: and <i>Tacitus</i> <a
  name="NtA_335" href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> tells us from an
  inscription seen at <i>Thebes</i> by <i>Cæsar Germanicus,</i> and
  interpreted to him by the <i>Egyptian</i> Priests, that this King
  <i>Ramesses</i> had an army of 700000 men, and Reigned over <i>Libya</i>,
  <i>Ethiopia</i>, <i>Media</i>, <i>Persia</i>, <i>Bactria</i>,
  <i>Scythia</i>, <i>Armenia</i>, <i>Cappadocia</i>, <i>Bithynia</i>, and
  <i>Lycia</i>; whence the Monarchy of <i>Assyria</i> was not yet risen.
  This King was very covetous, and a great collector of taxes, and one of
  the richest of all the Kings of <i>Egypt</i>, and built the western
  portico of the Temple of <i>Vulcan</i>.</p>

  <p><i>M&#339;ris</i> inheriting the riches of <i>Ramesses</i>, built the
  northern portico of that Temple more sumptuously, and made the Lake of
  <i>M&#339;ris,</i> with two great Pyramids of brick in the midst of it:
  and for preserving the division of <i>Egypt</i> into equal shares amongst
  the soldiers, this King wrote a book of surveying, which gave a beginning
  to Geometry. He is called also <i>Maris</i>, <i>Myris</i>, <i>Meres</i>,
  <i>Marres</i>, <i>Smarres</i>; and more corruptly, by changing <span
  lang="el" title="M" >&#x39C;</span> into <span lang="el" title="A, T, B,
  S, YCH, L" >&#x391;, &#x3A4;, &#x392;, &#x3A3;, Y&#x3A7;, &#x39B;</span>,
  &amp;c. <i>Ayres</i>, <i>Tyris</i>, <i>Byires</i>, <i>Soris</i>,
  <i>Uchoreus</i>, <i>Lachares</i>, <i>Labaris</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_336" href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a>
  places <i>Uchoreus</i> between <i>Osymanduas</i> and <i>Myris</i>, that
  is between <i>Amenophis</i> and <i>M&#339;ris</i>, and saith that he
  built <i>Memphis</i>, and fortified it to admiration with a mighty
  rampart of earth, and a broad and deep trench, which was filled with the
  water of the <i>Nile</i>, and made there a vast and deep Lake for
  receiving the water of the <i>Nile</i> in the time of its overflowing,
  and built palaces in the city; and that this place was so commodiously
  seated that most of the Kings who Reigned after him preferred it before
  <i>Thebes</i>, and removed the Court from thence to this place, so that
  the magnificence of <i>Thebes</i> from that time began to decrease, and
  that of <i>Memphis</i> to increase, 'till <i>Alexander</i> King of
  <i>Macedon</i> built <i>Alexandria</i>. These great works of
  <i>Uchoreus</i> and those of <i>M&#339;ris</i> savour of one and the same
  genius, and were certainly done by one and the same King, distinguished
  into two by a corruption of the name as above; for this Lake of
  <i>Uchoreus</i> was certainly the same with that of
  <i>M&#339;ris</i>.</p>

  <p>After the example of the two brick Pyramids made by <i>M&#339;ris</i>,
  the three next Kings, <i>Cheops</i>, <i>Cephren</i> and <i>Mycerinus</i>
  built the three great Pyramids at <i>Memphis</i>; and therefore Reigned
  in that city. <i>Cheops</i> shut up the Temples of the <i>Nomes</i>, and
  prohibited the worship of the Gods of <i>Egypt</i>, designing no doubt to
  have been worshipped himself after death: he is called also
  <i>Chembis</i>, <i>Chemmis</i>, <i>Chemnis</i>, <i>Phiops</i>,
  <i>Apathus</i>, <i>Apappus</i>, <i>Suphis</i>, <i>Saophis</i>,
  <i>Syphoas</i>, <i>Syphaosis</i>, <i>Soiphis</i>, <i>Syphuris</i>,
  <i>Anoiphis</i>, <i>Anoisis</i>: he built the biggest of the three great
  Pyramids which stand together; and his brother <i>Cephren</i> or
  <i>Cerpheres</i> built the second, and his son <i>Mycerinus</i> founded
  the third: this last King was celebrated for clemency and justice; he
  shut up the dead body of his daughter in a hollow ox, and caused her to
  be worshipped daily with odours: he is called also <i>Cheres</i>,
  <i>Cherinus</i>, <i>Bicheres</i>, <i>Moscheres</i>, <i>Mencheres</i>. He
  died before the third Pyramid was finished, and his sister and successor
  <i>Nitocris</i> finished it.</p>

  <p>Then Reigned <i>Asychis</i>, who built the eastern portico of the
  Temple of <i>Vulcan</i> very splendidly, and among the small Pyramids a
  large Pyramid of brick, made of mud dug out of the Lake of
  <i>M&#339;ris</i>: and these are the Kings who Reigned at <i>Memphis</i>,
  and spent their time in adorning that city, until the <i>Ethiopians</i>
  and the <i>Assyrians</i> and others revolted, and <i>Egypt</i> lost all
  her dominion abroad, and became again divided into several small
  Kingdoms.</p>

  <p>One of those Kingdoms was I think at <i>Memphis</i>, under
  <i>Gnephactus</i>, and his son and successor <i>Bocchoris</i>.
  <i>Africanus</i> calls <i>Bocchoris</i> a <i>Saite</i>; but <i>Sais</i>
  at this time had other Kings: <i>Gnephactus</i>, otherwise called
  <i>Neochabis</i> and <i>Technatis</i>, cursed <i>Menes</i> for his
  luxury, and caused the curse to be entered in the Temple of
  <i>Jupiter</i> at <i>Thebes</i>; and therefore Reigned over
  <i>Thebais</i>: and <i>Bocchoris</i> sent in a wild bull upon the God
  <i>Mnevis</i> which was worshipped at <i>Heliopolis</i>. Another of those
  Kingdoms was at <i>Anysis</i>, or <i>Hanes</i>, <i>Isa.</i> xxx. 4. under
  its King <i>Anysis</i> or <i>Amosis</i>; a third was at <i>Sais</i>,
  under <i>Stephanathis</i>, <i>Nechepsos</i>, and <i>Nechus</i>; and a
  fourth was at <i>Tanis</i> or <i>Zoan</i>, under <i>Petubastes</i>,
  <i>Osorchon</i> and <i>Psammis</i>: and <i>Egypt</i> being weakened by
  this division, was invaded and conquered by the <i>Ethiopians</i> under
  <i>Sabacon</i>, who slew <i>Bocchoris</i> and <i>Nechus</i>, and made
  <i>Anysis</i> fly. The Olympiads began in the Reign of <i>Petubastes</i>,
  and the <i>Æra</i> of <i>Nabonassar</i> in the 22d year of the Reign of
  <i>Bocchoris</i>, according to <i>Africanus</i>; and therefore the
  division, of <i>Egypt</i> into many Kingdoms began before the Olympiads,
  but not above the length of two Kings Reigns before them.</p>

  <p>After the study of Astronomy was set on foot for the use of
  navigation, and the <i>Egyptians</i> by the Heliacal Risings and Settings
  of the Stars had determined the length of the Solar year of 365 days, and
  by other observations had fixed the Solstices, and formed the fixt Stars
  into Asterisms, all which was done in the Reign of <i>Ammon</i>,
  <i>Sesac</i>, <i>Orus</i>, and <i>Memnon</i>; it may be presumed that
  they continued to observe the motions of the Planets; for they called
  them after the names of their Gods; and <i>Nechepsos</i> or
  <i>Nicepsos</i> King of <i>Sais</i>, by the assistance of
  <i>Petosiris</i> a Priest of <i>Egypt</i>, invented Astrology, grounding
  it upon the aspects of the Planets, and the qualities of the men and
  women to whom they were dedicated: and in the beginning of the Reign of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> King of <i>Babylon</i>, about which time the
  <i>Ethiopians</i> under <i>Sabacon</i> invaded <i>Egypt</i>, those
  <i>Egyptians</i> who fled from him to <i>Babylon</i>, carried thither the
  <i>Egyptian</i> year of 365 days, and the study of Astronomy and
  Astrology, and founded the <i>Æra</i> of <i>Nabonassar</i>; dating it
  from the first year of that King's Reign, which was the 22d year <i>of
  Bocchoris</i> as above, and beginning the year on the same day with the
  <i>Egyptians</i> for the sake of their calculations. So <i>Diodorus</i>
  <a name="NtA_337" href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a>: <i>they say that
  the </i>Chaldæans<i> in </i>Babylon<i>, being Colonies of the
  </i>Egyptians<i>, became famous for Astrology, having learnt it from the
  Priests of </i>Egypt: and <i>Hestiæus</i>, who wrote an history of
  <i>Egypt</i>, speaking of a disaster of the invaded <i>Egyptians</i>,
  saith <a name="NtA_338" href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> that <i>the
  Priests who survived this disaster, taking with them the </i>Sacra<i> of
  </i>Jupiter Enyalius<i>, came to </i>Sennaar<i> in </i>Babylonia. From
  the 15th year of <i>Asa</i>, in which <i>Zerah</i> was beaten, and
  <i>Menes</i> or <i>Amenophis</i> began his Reign, to the beginning of the
  <i>Æra</i> of <i>Nabonassar</i>, were 200 years; and this interval of
  time allows room for about nine or ten Reigns of Kings, at about twenty
  years to a Reign one with another; and so many Reigns there were,
  according to the account set down above out of <i>Herodotus</i>; and
  therefore that account, as it is the oldest, and was received by
  <i>Herodotus</i> from the Priests of <i>Thebes</i>, <i>Memphis</i>, and
  <i>Heliopolis</i>, three principal cities of <i>Egypt</i>, agrees also
  with the course of nature, and leaves no room for the Reigns of the many
  nameless Kings which we have omitted. These omitted Kings Reigned before
  <i>M&#339;ris</i>, and by consequence at <i>Thebes</i>; for
  <i>M&#339;ris</i> translated the seat of the Empire from <i>Thebes</i> to
  <i>Memphis</i>: they Reigned after <i>Ramesses</i>; for <i>Ramesses</i>
  was the son and successor of <i>Menes</i>, who Reigned next after the
  Gods. Now <i>Menes</i> built the body of the Temple of <i>Vulcan</i>,
  <i>Ramesses</i> the first portico, and <i>M&#339;ris</i> the second
  portico thereof; but the <i>Egyptians</i>, for making their Gods and
  Kingdom look ancient, have inserted between the builders of the first and
  second portico of this Temple, three hundred and thirty Kings of
  <i>Thebes</i>, and supposed that these Kings Reigned eleven thousand
  years; as if any Temple could stand so long. This being a manifest
  fiction, we have corrected it, by omitting those interposed Kings, who
  did nothing, and placing <i>M&#339;ris</i> the builder of the second
  portico, next after <i>Ramesses</i> the builder of the first.</p>

  <p>In the Dynasties of <i>Manetho</i>; <i>Sevechus</i> is made the
  successor of <i>Sabacon</i>, being his son; and perhaps he is the
  <i>Sethon</i> of <i>Herodotus</i>, who became Priest of <i>Vulcan</i>,
  and neglected military discipline: for <i>Sabacon</i> is that <i>So</i>
  or <i>Sua</i> with whom <i>Hoshea</i> King of <i>Israel</i> conspired
  against the <i>Assyrians</i>, in the fourth year of <i>Hezekiah</i>,
  <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 24. <i>Herodotus</i> tells us twice or thrice, that
  <i>Sabacon</i> after a long Reign of fifty years relinquished
  <i>Egypt</i> voluntarily, and that <i>Anysis</i> who fled from him,
  returned and Reigned again in the lower <i>Egypt</i> after him, or rather
  with him: and that <i>Sethon</i> Reigned after <i>Sabacon</i>, and went
  to <i>Pelusium</i> against the army of <i>Sennacherib</i>, and was
  relieved with a great multitude of mice, which eat the bow-strings of the
  <i>Assyrians</i>; in memory of which the statue of <i>Sethon</i>, seen by
  <i>Herodotus</i>, <a name="NtA_339" href="#Nt_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a>
  was made with a Mouse in its hand. A Mouse was the <i>Egyptian</i> symbol
  of destruction, and the Mouse in the hand of <i>Sethon</i> signifies only
  that he overcame the <i>Assyrians</i> with a great destruction. The
  Scriptures inform us, that when <i>Sennacherib</i> invaded <i>Judæa</i>
  and besieged <i>Lachish</i> and <i>Libnah</i>, which was in the 14th year
  of <i>Hezekiah</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 34. the King of <i>Judah</i>
  trusted upon <i>Pharaoh</i> King of <i>Egypt</i>, that is upon
  <i>Sethon</i>, and that <i>Tirhakah</i> King of <i>Ethiopia</i> came out
  also to fight against <i>Sennacherib</i>, 2 <i>King.</i> xviii. 21. &amp;
  xix. 9. which makes it probable, that when <i>Sennacherib</i> heard of
  the Kings of <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Ethiopia</i> coming against him, he went
  from <i>Libnah</i> towards <i>Pelusium</i> to oppose them, and was there
  surprized and set upon in the night by them both, and routed with as
  great a slaughter as if the bow-strings of the <i>Assyrians</i> had been
  eaten by mice. Some think that the <i>Assyrians</i> were smitten by
  lightning, or by a fiery wind which sometimes comes from the southern
  parts of <i>Chaldæa</i>. After this victory <i>Tirhakah</i> succeeding
  <i>Sethon</i>, carried his arms westward through <i>Libya</i> and
  <i>Afric</i> to the mouth of the <i>Straits</i>: but <i>Herodotus</i>
  tells us, that the Priests of <i>Egypt</i> reckoned <i>Sethon</i> the
  last King of <i>Egypt</i>, who Reigned before the division of
  <i>Egypt</i> into twelve contemporary Kingdoms, and by consequence before
  the invasion of <i>Egypt</i> by the <i>Assyrians</i>.</p>

  <p>For <i>Asserhadon</i> King of <i>Assyria</i>, in the 68th year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i>, after he had Reigned about thirty years over
  <i>Assyria</i>, invaded the Kingdom of <i>Babylon</i>, and then carried
  into captivity many people from <i>Babylon</i>, and <i>Cuthah</i>, and
  <i>Ava</i>, and <i>Hamath</i>, and <i>Sepharvaim</i>, placing them in the
  Regions of <i>Samaria</i> and <i>Damascus</i>: and from thence they
  carried into <i>Babylonia</i> and <i>Assyria</i> the remainder of the
  people of <i>Israel</i> and <i>Syria</i>, which had been left there by
  <i>Tiglath-pileser</i>. This captivity was 65 years after the first year
  of <i>Ahaz</i>, <i>Isa</i>. vii. 1, 8. &amp; 2. <i>King.</i> xv. 37.
  &amp; xvi. 5. and by consequence in the twentieth year of
  <i>Manasseh</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 69. and then <i>Tartan</i> was
  sent by <i>Asserhadon</i> with an army against <i>Ashdod</i> or
  <i>Azoth</i>, a town at that time subject to <i>Judæa</i>, 2
  <i>Chron.</i> xxvi. 6. and took it, <i>Isa.</i> xx. 1: and this post
  being secured, the <i>Assyrians</i> beat the <i>Jews</i>, and captivated
  <i>Manasseh</i>, and subdued <i>Judæa</i>: and in these wars,
  <i>Isaiah</i> was saw'd asunder by the command of <i>Manasseh</i>, for
  prophesying against him. Then the <i>Assyrians</i> invaded and subdued
  <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Ethiopia</i>, and carried the <i>Egyptians</i> and
  <i>Ethiopians</i> into captivity, and thereby put an end to the Reign of
  the <i>Ethiopians</i> over <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Isa.</i> vii. 18. &amp; viii.
  7. &amp; x. 11, 12, &amp; xix. 23. &amp; xx. 4. In this war the city
  <i>No-Ammon</i> or <i>Thebes</i>, which had hitherto continued in a
  flourishing condition, was miserably wasted and led into captivity, as is
  described by <i>Nahum</i>, chap. iii. ver. 8, 9, 10; for <i>Nahum</i>
  wrote after the last invasion of <i>Judæa</i> by the <i>Assyrians</i>,
  chap. i. ver. 15; and therefore describes this captivity as fresh in
  memory: and this and other following invasions of <i>Egypt</i> under
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and <i>Cambyses</i>, put an end to the glory of
  that city. <i>Asserhadon</i> Reigned over the <i>Egyptians</i> and
  <i>Ethiopians</i> three years, <i>Isa.</i> xx. 3, 4. that is until his
  death, which was in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 81, and therefore
  invaded <i>Egypt</i>, and put an end to the Reign of the
  <i>Ethiopians</i> over the <i>Egyptians</i>, in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 78; so that the <i>Ethiopians</i> under <i>Sabacon</i>,
  and his successors <i>Sethon</i> and <i>Tirhakah</i>, Reigned over
  <i>Egypt</i> about 80 years: <i>Herodotus</i> allots 50 years to
  <i>Sabacon</i>, and <i>Africanus</i> fourteen years to <i>Sethon</i>, and
  eighteen to <i>Tirhakah</i>.</p>

  <p>The division of <i>Egypt</i> into more Kingdoms than one, both before
  and after the Reign of the <i>Ethiopians</i>, and the conquest of the
  <i>Egyptians</i> by <i>Asserhadon</i>, the prophet <i>Isaiah</i> <a
  name="NtA_340" href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> seems allude unto in
  these words: <i>I will set</i>, saith he, <i>the </i>Egyptians<i> against
  the </i>Egyptians<i>, and they shall fight every one against his brother,
  and every one against his neighbour, city against city, and Kingdom
  against Kingdom, and the Spirit of </i>Egypt<i> shall fail.&mdash;And the
  </i>Egyptians<i> will I give over into the hand of a cruel Lord </i>[viz.
  <i>Asserhadon</i>]<i> and a fierce King shall Reign over
  them.&mdash;Surely the Princes of </i>Zoan<i> </i>[Tanis]<i> are fools,
  the counsel of the wise Councellors of </i>Pharaoh<i> is become brutish:
  how long say ye unto </i>Pharaoh<i>, I am the son of the ancient
  Kings.&mdash;The Princes of </i>Zoan<i> are be come fools: the Princes of
  </i>Noph<i> </i>[Memphis]<i> are deceived,&mdash;even they that were the
  stay of the tribes thereof.&mdash;In that day there shall be a high-way
  out of </i>Egypt<i> into </i>Assyria<i>, and the </i>Egyptians<i> shall
  serve the </i>Assyrians.</p>

  <p>After the death of <i>Asserhadon</i>, <i>Egypt</i> remained subject to
  twelve contemporary Kings, who revolted from the <i>Assyrians</i>, and
  Reigned together fifteen years; including I think the three years of
  <i>Asserhadon</i>, because the <i>Egyptians</i> do not reckon him among
  their Kings. They <a name="NtA_341" href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a>
  built the Labyrinth adjoining to the Lake of <i>M&#339;ris</i> which was
  a very magnificent structure, with twelve Halls in it, for their Palaces:
  and then <i>Psammitichus</i>, who was one of the twelve, conquered all
  the rest. He built the last Portico of the Temple of <i>Vulcan</i>,
  founded by <i>Menes</i> about 260 years before, and Reigned 54 years,
  including the fifteen years of his Reign with the twelve Kings. Then
  Reigned <i>Nechaoh</i> or <i>Nechus</i>, 17 years; <i>Psammis</i> six
  years; <i>Vaphres</i>, <i>Apries</i>, <i>Eraphius</i>, or <i>Hophra</i>,
  25 years; <i>Amasis</i> 44 years; and <i>Psammenitus</i> six months,
  according to <i>Herodotus</i>. <i>Egypt</i> was subdued by
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> in the last year but one of <i>Hophra</i>, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 178, and remained in subjection to <i>Babylon</i> forty
  years, <i>Jer.</i> xliv. 30. &amp; <i>Ezek.</i> xxix. 12, 13, 14, 17, 19.
  that is, almost all the Reign of <i>Amasis</i>, a plebeian set over
  <i>Egypt</i> by the conqueror: the forty years ended with the death of
  <i>Cyrus</i>; for he Reigned over <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Ethiopia</i>,
  according to <i>Xenophon</i>. At that time therefore those nations
  recovered their liberty; but after four or five years more they were
  invaded and conquered by <i>Cambyses</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 223 or
  224, and have almost ever since remained in servitude, as was predicted
  by the Prophets.</p>

  <p>The Reigns of <i>Psammitichus</i>, <i>Nechus</i>, <i>Psammis</i>,
  <i>Apries</i>, <i>Amasis</i>, and <i>Psammenitus</i>, set down by
  <i>Herodotus</i>, amount unto 146½ years: and so many years there were
  from the 78th year of <i>Nabonassar</i>, in which the dominion of the
  <i>Ethiopians</i> over <i>Egypt</i> came to an end, unto the 224th year
  of <i>Nabonassar</i>, in which <i>Cambyses</i> invaded <i>Egypt</i>, and
  put an end to that Kingdom: which is an argument that <i>Herodotus</i>
  was circumspect and faithful in his narrations, and has given us a good
  account of the antiquities of <i>Egypt</i>, so far as the Priests of
  <i>Egypt</i> at <i>Thebes</i>, <i>Memphis</i>, and <i>Heliopolis</i>, and
  the <i>Carians</i> and <i>Ionians</i> inhabiting <i>Egypt</i>, were then
  able to inform him: for he consulted them all; and the <i>Cares</i> and
  <i>Ionians</i> had been in <i>Egypt</i> from the time of the Reign of the
  twelve contemporary Kings.</p>

  <p><i>Pliny</i> <a name="NtA_342" href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a>
  tells us, that the <i>Egyptian</i> Obelisks were of a sort of stone dug
  near <i>Syene</i> in <i>Thebais</i>, and that the first Obelisk was made
  by <i>Mitres</i>, who Reigned in <i>Heliopolis</i>; that is, by
  <i>Mephres</i> the predecessor of <i>Misphragmuthosis</i>; and that
  afterwards other Kings made others: <i>Sochis</i>, that is
  <i>Sesochis</i>, or <i>Sesac</i>, four, each of 48 cubits in length;
  <i>Ramises</i>, that is <i>Ramesses</i>, two; <i>Smarres</i>, that is
  <i>M&#339;ris</i>, one of 48 cubits in length; <i>Eraphius</i>, or
  <i>Hophra</i>, one of 48; and <i>Nectabis</i>, or <i>Nectenabis</i>, one
  of 80. <i>Mephres</i> therefore extended his dominion over all the upper
  <i>Egypt</i>, from <i>Syene</i> to <i>Heliopolis</i>, and after him,
  <i>Misphragmuthosis</i> and <i>Amosis</i>, Reigned <i>Ammon</i> and
  <i>Sesac</i>, who erected the first great Empire in the world: and these
  four, <i>Amosis</i>, <i>Ammon</i>, <i>Sesac</i>, and <i>Orus</i>, Reigned
  in the four ages of the great Gods of <i>Egypt</i>; and <i>Amenophis</i>
  was the <i>Menes</i> who Reigned next after them: he was Succeeded by
  <i>Ramesses</i>, and <i>M&#339;ris</i>, and some time after by
  <i>Hophra</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_343" href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a>
  recites the same Kings of <i>Egypt</i> with <i>Herodotus</i>, but in a
  more confused order, and repeats some of them twice, or oftener, under
  various names, and omits others: his Kings are these; <i>Jupiter
  Ammon</i> and <i>Juno</i>, <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i>, <i>Horus</i>,
  <i>Menes</i>, <i>Busiris</i> I, <i>Busiris</i> II, <i>Osymanduas</i>,
  <i>Uchoreus</i>, <i>Myris</i>, <i>Sesoosis</i> I, <i>Sesoosis</i> II,
  <i>Amasis</i>, <i>Actisanes</i>, <i>Mendes</i> or <i>Marrus</i>,
  <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Remphis</i>, <i>Chembis</i>, <i>Cephren</i>,
  <i>Mycerinus</i> or <i>Cherinus</i>, <i>Gnephacthus</i>,
  <i>Bocchoris</i>, <i>Sabacon</i>, twelve contemporary Kings,
  <i>Psammitichus</i>, * * <i>Apries</i>, <i>Amasis</i>. Here I take
  <i>Sesoosis</i> I, and <i>Sesoosis</i> II, <i>Busiris</i> I, and
  <i>Busiris</i> II, to be the same Kings with <i>Osiris</i> and
  <i>Orus</i>: also <i>Osymanduas</i> to be the same with <i>Amenophis</i>
  or <i>Menes</i>: also <i>Amasis</i>, and <i>Actisanes</i>, an
  <i>Ethiopian</i> who conquered him, to be the same with <i>Anysis</i> and
  <i>Sabacon</i> in <i>Herodotus</i>: and <i>Uchoreus</i>, <i>Mendes</i>,
  <i>Marrus</i>, and <i>Myris</i>, to be only several names of one and the
  same King. Whence the catalogue of <i>Diodorus</i> will be reduced to
  this: <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> and <i>Juno</i>; <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Busiris</i>
  or <i>Sesoosis</i>, and <i>Isis</i>; <i>Horus</i>, <i>Busiris</i> II, or
  <i>Sesoosis</i> II; <i>Menes</i>, or <i>Osymanduas</i>; <i>Proteus</i>;
  <i>Remphis</i> or <i>Ramesses</i>; <i>Uchoreus</i>, <i>Mendes</i>,
  <i>Marrus</i>, or <i>Myris</i>; <i>Chembis</i> or <i>Cheops</i>;
  <i>Cephren</i>; <i>Mycerinus</i>; * * <i>Gnephacthus</i>;
  <i>Bocchoris</i>; <i>Amasis</i>, or <i>Anysis</i>; <i>Actisanes</i>, or
  <i>Sabacon</i>; * twelve contemporary Kings; <i>Psammitichus</i>; * *
  <i>Apries</i>; <i>Amasis</i>: to which, if in their proper places you add
  <i>Nitocris</i>, <i>Asychis</i>, <i>Sethon</i>, <i>Nechus</i>, and
  <i>Psammis,</i> you will have the catalogue of <i>Herodotus</i>.</p>

  <p>The Dynasties of <i>Manetho</i> and <i>Eratosthenes</i> seem to be
  filled with many such names of Kings as <i>Herodotus</i> omitted: when it
  shall be made appear that any of them Reigned in <i>Egypt</i> after the
  expulsion of the Shepherds, and were different from the Kings described
  above, they may be inserted in their proper places.</p>

  <p><i>Egypt</i> was conquered by the <i>Ethiopians</i> under
  <i>Sabacon</i>, about the beginning of the <i>Æra</i> of
  <i>Nabonassar</i>, or perhaps three or four years before, that is, about
  three hundred years before <i>Herodotus</i> wrote his history; and about
  eighty years after that conquest, it was conquered again by the
  <i>Assyrians</i> under <i>Asserhadon</i>: and the history of <i>Egypt</i>
  set down by <i>Herodotus</i> from the time of this last conquest, is
  right both as to the number, and order, and names of the Kings, and as to
  the length of their Reigns: and therein he is now followed by historians,
  being the only author who hath given us so good a history of
  <i>Egypt</i>, for that interval of time. If his history of the earlier
  times be less accurate, it was because the archives of <i>Egypt</i> had
  suffered much during the Reign of the <i>Ethiopians</i> and
  <i>Assyrians</i>: and it is not likely that the Priests of <i>Egypt</i>,
  who lived two or three hundred years after the days of <i>Herodotus</i>,
  could mend the matter: on the contrary, after <i>Cambyses</i> had carried
  away the records of <i>Egypt</i>, the Priests were daily feigning new
  Kings, to make their Gods and nation look ancient; as is manifest by
  comparing <i>Herodotus</i> with <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, and both of them
  with what <i>Plato</i> relates out of the Poem of <i>Solon</i>: which
  Poem makes the wars of the great Gods of <i>Egypt</i> against the
  <i>Greeks</i>, to have been in the days of <i>Cecrops</i>,
  <i>Erechtheus</i> and <i>Erichthonius</i>, and a little before those of
  <i>Theseus</i>; these Gods at that time instituting Temples and Sacred
  Rites to themselves. I have therefore chosen to rely upon the stories
  related to <i>Herodotus</i> by the Priests of <i>Egypt</i> in those days,
  and corrected by the Poem of <i>Solon</i>, so as to make these Gods of
  <i>Egypt</i> no older than <i>Cecrops</i> and <i>Erechtheus</i>, and
  their successor <i>Menes</i> no older than <i>Theseus</i> and
  <i>Memnon</i>, and the Temple of <i>Vulcan</i> not above 280 years in
  building: rather than to correct <i>Herodotus</i> by <i>Manetho</i>,
  <i>Eratosthenes</i>, <i>Diodorus</i>, and others, who lived after the
  Priests of <i>Egypt</i> had corrupted their Antiquities much more than
  they had done in the days of <i>Herodotus</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAP. III.</h2>

<h3><i>Of the </i>A<font class="sc">SSYRIAN</font><i> Empire.</i></h3>

  <p>As the Gods or ancient Deified Kings and Princes of <i>Greece</i>,
  <i>Egypt</i>, and <i>Syria</i> of <i>Damascus</i>, have been made much
  ancienter than the truth, so have those of <i>Chaldæa</i> and
  <i>Assyria</i>: for <i>Diodorus</i> <a name="NtA_344"
  href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a> tells us, that when <i>Alexander</i>
  the great was in <i>Asia</i>, the <i>Chaldæans</i> reckoned 473000 years
  since they first began to observe the Stars; and <i>Ctesias</i>, and the
  ancient <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> writers who copy from him, have
  made the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire as old as <i>Noah</i>'s flood within 60
  or 70 years, and tell us the names of all the Kings of <i>Assyria</i>
  downwards, from <i>Belus</i> and his feigned son <i>Ninus</i>, to
  <i>Sardanapalus</i> the last King of that Monarchy: but the names of his
  Kings, except two or three, have no affinity with the names of the
  <i>Assyrians</i> mentioned in Scripture; for the <i>Assyrians</i> were
  usually named after their Gods, <i>Bel</i> or <i>Pul</i>; <i>Chaddon</i>,
  <i>Hadon</i>, <i>Adon</i>, or <i>Adonis</i>; <i>Melech</i> or
  <i>Moloch</i>; <i>Atsur</i> or <i>Assur</i>; <i>Nebo</i>; <i>Nergal</i>;
  <i>Merodach</i>: as in these names, <i>Pul</i>, <i>Tiglath-Pul-Assur</i>,
  <i>Salman-Assur</i>, <i>Adra-Melech</i>, <i>Shar-Assur</i>,
  <i>Assur-Hadon</i>, <i>Sardanapalus</i> or <i>Assur-Hadon-Pul</i>,
  <i>Nabonassar</i> or <i>Nebo-Adon-Assur</i>, <i>Bel Adon</i>,
  <i>Chiniladon</i> or <i>Chen-El-Adon</i>, <i>Nebo-Pul-Assur</i>,
  <i>Nebo-Chaddon-Assur</i>, <i>Nebuzaradon</i> or <i>Nebo-Assur-Adon</i>,
  <i>Nergal-Assur</i>, <i>Nergal-Shar-Assur</i>, <i>Labo-Assur-dach</i>,
  <i>Sheseb-Assur</i>, <i>Beltes-Assur</i>, <i>Evil-Merodach</i>,
  <i>Shamgar-Nebo</i>, <i>Rabsaris</i> or <i>Rab-Assur</i>,
  <i>Nebo-Shashban</i>, <i>Mardocempad</i> or <i>Merodach-Empad</i>. Such
  were the <i>Assyrian</i> names; but those in <i>Ctesias</i> are of
  another sort, except <i>Sardanapalus</i>, whose name he had met with in
  <i>Herodotus</i>. He makes <i>Semiramis</i> as old as the first
  <i>Belus</i>; but <i>Herodotus</i> tells us, that she was but five
  Generations older than the mother of <i>Labynetus</i>: he represents that
  the city <i>Ninus</i> was founded by a man of the same name, and
  <i>Babylon</i> by <i>Semiramis</i>; whereas either <i>Nimrod</i> or
  <i>Assur</i> founded those and other cities, without giving his own name
  to any of them: he makes the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire continue about 1360
  years, whereas <i>Herodotus</i> tells us that it lasted only 500 years,
  and the numbers of <i>Herodotus</i> concerning those ancient times are
  all of them too long: he makes <i>Nineveh</i> destroyed by the
  <i>Medes</i> and <i>Babylonians</i>, three hundred years before the Reign
  of <i>Astibares</i> and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> who destroyed it, and sets
  down the names of seven or eight feigned Kings of <i>Media</i>, between
  the destruction of <i>Nineveh</i> and the Reigns of <i>Astibares</i> and
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, as if the Empire of the <i>Medes</i>, erected upon
  the ruins of the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire, had lasted 300 years, whereas it
  lasted but 72: and the true Empire of the <i>Assyrians</i> described in
  Scripture, whose Kings were <i>Pul</i>, <i>Tiglath-pilesar</i>,
  <i>Shalmaneser</i>, <i>Sennacherib</i>, <i>Asserhadon</i>, &amp;c. he
  mentions not, tho' much nearer to his own times; which shews that he was
  ignorant of the antiquities of the <i>Assyrians</i>. Yet something of
  truth there is in the bottom of some of his stories, as there uses to be
  in Romances; as, that <i>Nineveh</i> was destroyed by the <i>Medes</i>
  and <i>Babylonians</i>; that <i>Sardanapalus</i> was the last King of the
  <i>Assyrian</i> Empire; and that <i>Astibares</i> and <i>Astyages</i>
  were Kings of the <i>Medes</i>: but he has made all things too ancient,
  and out of vainglory taken too great a liberty in feigning names and
  stories to please his reader.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Jews</i> were newly returned from the <i>Babylonian</i>
  captivity, they confessed their Sins in this manner, <i>Now therefore our
  God, &mdash;&mdash; let not all the trouble seem little before thee that
  hath come upon us, on our Kings, on our Princes, and on our Priests, and
  on our Prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the
  time of the Kings of </i>Assyria<i>, unto this day</i>; <i>Nehem.</i> ix.
  32. that is, since the time of the Kingdom of <i>Assyria</i>, or since
  the rise of that Empire; and therefore the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire arose
  when the Kings of <i>Assyria</i> began to afflict the inhabitants of
  <i>Palestine</i>; which was in the days of <i>Pul</i>: he and his
  successors afflicted <i>Israel</i>, and conquered the nations round about
  them; and upon the ruin of many small and ancient Kingdoms erected their
  Empire, conquering the <i>Medes</i> as well as other nations: but of
  these conquests <i>Ctesias</i> knew not a word, no not so much as the
  names of the conquerors, or that there was an <i>Assyrian</i> Empire then
  standing; for he supposes that the <i>Medes</i> Reigned at that time, and
  that the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire was at an end above 250 years before it
  began.</p>

  <p>However we must allow that <i>Nimrod</i> founded a Kingdom at
  <i>Babylon</i>, and perhaps extended it into <i>Assyria</i>: but this
  Kingdom was but of small extent, if compared with the Empires which rose
  up afterwards; being only within the fertile plains of <i>Chaldæa</i>,
  <i>Chalonitis</i> and <i>Assyria</i>, watered by the <i>Tigris</i> and
  <i>Euphrates</i>: and if it had been greater, yet it was but of short
  continuance, it being the custom in those early ages for every father to
  divide his territories amongst his sons. So <i>Noah</i> was King of all
  the world, and <i>Cham</i> was King of all <i>Afric</i>, and
  <i>Japhet</i> of all <i>Europe</i> and <i>Asia minor</i>; but they left
  no standing Kingdoms. After the days of <i>Nimrod</i>, we hear no more of
  an <i>Assyrian</i> Empire 'till the days of <i>Pul</i>. The four Kings
  who in the days of <i>Abraham</i> invaded the southern coast of
  <i>Canaan</i> came from the countries where <i>Nimrod</i> had Reigned,
  and perhaps were some of his posterity who had shared his conquests. In
  the time of the Judges of <i>Israel</i>, <i>Mesopotamia</i> was under its
  own King, <i>Judg.</i> iii. 8. and the King of <i>Zobah</i> Reigned on
  both sides of the River <i>Euphrates</i> 'till <i>David</i> conquered
  him, 2 <i>Sam.</i> viii, and x. The Kingdoms of <i>Israel</i>,
  <i>Moab</i>, <i>Ammon</i>, <i>Edom</i>, <i>Philistia</i>, <i>Zidon</i>,
  <i>Damascus</i>, and <i>Hamath</i> the great, continued subject to other
  Lords than the <i>Assyrians</i> 'till the days of <i>Pul</i> and his
  successors; and so did the house of <i>Eden</i>, <i>Amos</i> i. 5. 2
  <i>Kings</i> xix. 12. and <i>Haran</i> or <i>Carrhæ</i>, <i>Gen.</i> xii.
  2 <i>Kings</i> xix. 12. and <i>Sepharvaim</i> in <i>Mesopotamia</i>, and
  <i>Calneh</i> near <i>Bagdad</i>, <i>Gen.</i> x. 10, <i>Isa.</i> x. 9, 2
  <i>Kings</i> xvii. 31. <i>Sesac</i> and <i>Memnon</i> were great
  conquerors, and Reigned over <i>Chaldæa</i>, <i>Assyria</i>, and
  <i>Persia</i>, but in their histories there is not a word of any
  opposition made to them by an <i>Assyrian</i> Empire then standing: on
  the contrary, <i>Susiana</i>, <i>Media</i>, <i>Persia</i>,
  <i>Bactria</i>, <i>Armenia</i>, <i>Cappadocia</i>, &amp;c. were conquered
  by them, and continued subject to the Kings of <i>Egypt</i> 'till after
  the long Reign of <i>Ramesses</i> the son of <i>Memnon</i>, as above.</p>

  <p><i>Homer</i> mentions <i>Bacchus</i> and <i>Memnon</i> Kings of
  <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Persia</i>, but knew nothing of an <i>Assyrian</i>
  Empire. <i>Jonah</i> prophesied when <i>Israel</i> was in affliction
  under the King of <i>Syria</i>, and this was in the latter part of the
  Reign of <i>Jehoahaz</i>, and first part of the Reign of <i>Joash</i>,
  Kings of <i>Israel</i>, and I think in the Reign of <i>M&#339;ris</i> the
  successor of <i>Ramesses</i> King of <i>Egypt</i>, and about sixty years
  before the Reign of <i>Pul</i>; and <i>Nineveh</i> was then a city of
  large extent, but full of pastures for cattle, so that it contained but
  about 120000 persons. It was not yet grown so great and potent as not to
  be terrified at the preaching of <i>Jonah</i>, and to fear being invaded
  by its neighbours and ruined within forty days: it had some time before
  got free from the dominion of <i>Egypt</i>, and had got a King of its
  own; but its King was not yet called King of <i>Assyria</i>, but only
  King of <i>Nineveh</i>, <i>Jonah</i> iii. 6, 7. and his proclamation for
  a fast was not published in several nations, nor in all <i>Assyria</i>,
  but only in <i>Nineveh</i>, and perhaps in the villages thereof; but soon
  after, when the dominion of <i>Nineveh</i> was established at home, and
  exalted over all <i>Assyria</i> properly so called, and this Kingdom
  began to make war upon the neighbouring nations, its Kings were no longer
  called Kings of <i>Nineveh</i> but began to be called Kings of
  <i>Assyria</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Amos</i> prophesied in the Reign of <i>Jeroboam</i> the Son of
  <i>Joash</i> King of <i>Israel</i>, soon after <i>Jeroboam</i> had
  subdued the Kingdoms of <i>Damascus</i> and <i>Hamath</i>, that is, about
  ten or twenty years before the Reign of <i>Pul</i>: and he <a
  name="NtA_345" href="#Nt_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> thus reproves
  <i>Israel</i> for being lifted up by those conquests; <i>Ye which rejoyce
  in a thing of nought, which say, have we not taken to us horns by our
  strength? But behold I will raise up against you a nation, O house of
  </i>Israel<i>, saith the Lord the God of Hosts, and they shall afflict
  you from the entring in of </i>Hamath<i> unto the river of the
  wilderness</i>. God here threatens to raise up a nation against
  <i>Israel</i>; but what nation he names not; that he conceals 'till the
  <i>Assyrians</i> should appear and discover it. In the prophesies of
  <i>Isaiah</i>, <i>Jeremiah</i>, <i>Ezekiel</i>, <i>Hosea</i>,
  <i>Micah</i>, <i>Nahum</i>, <i>Zephaniah</i> and <i>Zechariah</i>, which
  were written after the Monarchy grew up, it is openly named upon all
  occasions; but in this of <i>Amos</i> not once, tho' the captivity of
  <i>Israel</i> and <i>Syria</i> be the subject of the prophesy, and that
  of <i>Israel</i> be often threatned: he only saith in general that
  <i>Syria</i> should go into captivity unto <i>Kir</i>, and that
  <i>Israel</i>, notwithstanding her present greatness, should go into
  captivity beyond <i>Damascus</i>; and that God would raise up a nation to
  afflict them: meaning that he would raise up above them from a lower
  condition, a nation whom they yet feared not: for so the <i>Hebrew</i>
  word <span lang="he" title="mqm" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5E7;&#x5DD;</bdo></span> signifies when applied to
  men, as in <i>Amos</i> v. 2. 1 <i>Sam.</i> xii. 11. <i>Psal.</i> cxiii.
  7. <i>Jer.</i> x. 20. l. 32. <i>Hab.</i> i. 6. <i>Zech.</i> xi. 16. As
  <i>Amos</i> names not the <i>Assyrians</i>; at the writing of this
  prophecy they made no great figure in the world, but were to be raised up
  against <i>Israel</i>, and by consequence rose up in the days of
  <i>Pul</i> and his successors: for after <i>Jeroboam</i> had conquered
  <i>Damascus</i> and <i>Hamath</i>, his successor <i>Menahem</i> destroyed
  <i>Tiphsah</i> with its territories upon <i>Euphrates</i>, because they
  opened not to him: and therefore <i>Israel</i> continued in its greatness
  'till <i>Pul</i>, probably grown formidable by some victories, caused
  <i>Menahem</i> to buy his peace. <i>Pul</i> therefore Reigning presently
  after the prophesy of <i>Amos</i>, and being the first upon record who
  began to fulfill it, may be justly reckoned the first conqueror and
  founder of this Empire. For <i>God stirred up the spirit of </i>Pul<i>,
  and the spirit of </i>Tiglath-pileser<i> King of </i>Assyria, 1
  <i>Chron.</i> v. 20.</p>

  <p>The same Prophet <i>Amos</i>, in prophesying against <i>Israel</i>,
  threatned them in this manner, with what had lately befallen other
  Kingdoms: <i>Pass ye</i>, <a name="NtA_346"
  href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> saith he, <i>unto </i>Calneh<i> and
  see, and from thence go ye to </i>Hamath<i> the great, then go down to
  </i>Gath<i> of the </i>Philistims<i>. Be they better than these
  Kingdoms?</i> These Kingdoms were not yet conquered by the
  <i>Assyrians</i>, except that of <i>Calneh</i> or <i>Chalonitis</i> upon
  <i>Tigris</i>, between <i>Babylon</i> and <i>Nineveh</i>. <i>Gath</i> was
  newly vanquished <a name="NtA_347" href="#Nt_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> by
  <i>Uzziah</i> King of <i>Judah</i>, and <i>Hamath</i> <a name="NtA_348"
  href="#Nt_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a> by <i>Jeroboam</i> King of
  <i>Israel</i>: and while the Prophet, in threatning <i>Israel</i> with
  the <i>Assyrians</i>, instances in desolations made by other nations, and
  mentions no other conquest of the <i>Assyrians</i> than that of
  <i>Chalonitis</i> near <i>Nineveh</i>; it argues that the King of
  <i>Nineveh</i> was now beginning his conquests, and had not yet made any
  great progress in that vast career of victories, which we read of a few
  years after.</p>

  <p>For about seven years after the captivity of the ten Tribes, when
  <i>Sennacherib</i> warred in <i>Syria</i>, which was in the 16th
  Olympiad, he <a name="NtA_349" href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a> sent
  this message to the King of <i>Judah</i>: <i>Behold, thou hast heard that
  the Kings of </i>Assyria<i> have done to all Lands by destroying them
  utterly, and shalt thou be delivered? Have the Gods of the nations
  delivered them which the Gods of my fathers have destroyed, as
  </i>Gozan<i> and </i>Haran<i> and </i>Reseph<i>, and the children of
  </i>Eden<i> which were in </i>[the Kingdom of] Thelasar<i>? Where is the
  King of </i>Hamath<i>, and the King of </i>Arpad<i>, and the King of the
  city of </i>Sepharvaim<i>, and of </i>Hena<i> and </i>Ivah? And
  <i>Isaiah</i> <a name="NtA_350" href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> thus
  introduceth the King of <i>Assyria</i> boasting: <i>Are not my Princes
  altogether as Kings? Is not </i>Calno [or <i>Calneh</i>]<i> as
  </i>Carchemish<i>? Is not </i>Hamath<i> as </i>Arpad<i>? Is not
  </i>Samaria<i> as </i>Damascus<i>? As my hand hath found the Kingdoms of
  the Idols, and whose graven Images did excel them of </i>Jerusalem<i> and
  of </i>Samaria<i>; shall I not as I have done unto </i>Samaria<i> and her
  Idols, so do to </i>Jerusalem<i> and her Idols?</i> All this desolation
  is recited as fresh in memory to terrify the <i>Jews</i>, and these
  Kingdoms reach to the borders of <i>Assyria</i>, and to shew the
  largeness of the conquests they are called <i>all lands</i>, that is, all
  round about <i>Assyria</i>. It was the custom of the Kings of
  <i>Assyria</i>, for preventing the rebellion of people newly conquered,
  to captivate and transplant those of several countries into one another's
  lands, and intermix them variously: and thence it appears <a
  name="NtA_351" href="#Nt_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a> that <i>Halah</i>, and
  <i>Habor</i>, and <i>Hara</i>, and <i>Gozan</i>, and the cities of the
  <i>Medes</i> into which <i>Galilee</i> and <i>Samaria</i> were
  transplanted; and <i>Kir</i> into which <i>Damascus</i> was transplanted;
  and <i>Babylon</i> and <i>Cuth</i> or the <i>Susanchites</i>, and
  <i>Hamath</i>, and <i>Ava</i>, and <i>Sepharvaim</i>, and the
  <i>Dinaites</i>, and the <i>Apharsachites</i>, and the <i>Tarpelites</i>,
  and the <i>Archevites</i>, and the <i>Dehavites</i>, and the
  <i>Elamites</i>, or <i>Persians</i>, part of all which nations were led
  captive by <i>Asserhadon</i> and his predecessors into <i>Samaria</i>;
  were all of them conquered by the <i>Assyrians</i> not long before.</p>

  <p>In these conquests are involved on the west and south side of
  <i>Assyria</i>, the Kingdoms of <i>Mesopotamia</i>, whose royal seats
  were <i>Haran</i> or <i>Carrhæ</i>, and <i>Carchemish</i> or
  <i>Circutium</i>, and <i>Sepharvaim</i>, a city upon <i>Euphrates</i>,
  between <i>Babylon</i> and <i>Nineveh</i>, called <i>Sipparæ</i> by
  <i>Berosus</i>, <i>Abydenus</i>, and <i>Polyhistor</i>, and
  <i>Sipphara</i> by <i>Ptolomy</i>; and the Kingdoms of <i>Syria</i>
  seated at <i>Samaria</i>, <i>Damascus</i>, <i>Gath</i>, <i>Hamath</i>,
  <i>Arpad</i>, and <i>Reseph</i>, a city placed by <i>Ptolomy</i> near
  <i>Thapsacus</i>: on the south side and south east side were
  <i>Babylon</i> and <i>Calneh</i>, or <i>Calno</i>, a city which was
  founded by <i>Nimrod</i>, where <i>Bagdad</i> now stands, and gave the
  name of <i>Chalonitis</i> to a large region under its government; and
  <i>Thelasar</i> or <i>Talatha</i>, a city of the children of <i>Eden</i>,
  placed by <i>Ptolomy</i> in <i>Babylonia</i>, upon the common stream of
  <i>Tigris</i> and <i>Euphrates</i>, which was therefore the river of
  Paradise; and the <i>Archevites</i> at <i>Areca</i> or <i>Erech</i>, a
  city built by <i>Nimrod</i> on the east side of <i>Pasitigris</i>,
  between <i>Apamia</i> and the <i>Persian Gulph</i>; and the
  <i>Susanchites</i> at <i>Cuth</i>, or <i>Susa</i>, the metropolis of
  <i>Susiana</i>: on the east were <i>Elymais</i>, and some cities of the
  <i>Medes</i>, and <i>Kir</i>, <a name="NtA_352"
  href="#Nt_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a> a city and large region of
  <i>Media</i>, between <i>Elymais</i>, and <i>Assyria</i>, called
  <i>Kirene</i> by the <i>Chaldee</i> Paraphrast and <i>Latin</i>
  Interpreter, and <i>Carine</i> by <i>Ptolomy</i>: on the north-east were
  <i>Habor</i> or <i>Chaboras</i>, a mountainous region between
  <i>Assyria</i> and <i>Media</i>; and the <i>Apharsachites</i>, or men of
  <i>Arrapachitis</i>, a region originally peopled by <i>Arphaxad</i>, and
  placed by <i>Ptolomy</i> at the bottom of the mountains next
  <i>Assyria</i>: and on the north between <i>Assyria</i> and the
  <i>Gordiæan</i> mountains was <i>Halah</i> or <i>Chalach</i>, the
  metropolis of <i>Calachene</i>: and beyond these upon the <i>Caspian</i>
  sea was <i>Gozan</i>, called <i>Gauzania</i> by <i>Ptolomy</i>. Thus did
  these new conquests extend every way from the province of <i>Assyria</i>
  to considerable distances, and make up the great body of that Monarchy:
  so that well might the King of <i>Assyria</i> boast how his armies had
  destroyed all lands. All these nations <a name="NtA_353"
  href="#Nt_353"><sup>[353]</sup></a> had 'till now their several Gods, and
  each accounted his God the God of his own land, and the defender thereof,
  against the Gods of the neighbouring countries, and particularly against
  the Gods of <i>Assyria</i>; and therefore they were never 'till now
  united under the <i>Assyrian</i> Monarchy, especially since the King of
  <i>Assyria</i> doth not boast of their being conquered by the
  <i>Assyrians</i> oftner than once: but these being small Kingdoms the
  King of <i>Assyria</i> easily overflowed them: <i>Know ye not</i>, saith
  <a name="NtA_354" href="#Nt_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a> <i>Sennacherib</i>
  to the <i>Jews</i>, <i>what I and my fathers have done unto all the
  People of other lands?&mdash;for no God of any nation or kingdom was able
  to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my
  fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</i>
  He and his fathers therefore, <i>Pul</i>, <i>Tiglath-pileser</i>, and
  <i>Shalmaneser</i>, were great conquerors, and with a current of
  victories had newly overflowed all nations round about <i>Assyria</i>,
  and thereby set up this Monarchy.</p>

  <p>Between the Reigns of <i>Jeroboam</i> II, and his son
  <i>Zachariah</i>, there was an interregnum of about ten or twelve years
  in the Kingdom of <i>Israel</i>: and the prophet <i>Hosea</i> <a
  name="NtA_355" href="#Nt_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a> in the time of that
  interregnum, or soon after, mentions the King of <i>Assyria</i> by the
  name of <i>Jareb</i>, and another conqueror by the name of
  <i>Shalman</i>; and perhaps <i>Shalman</i> might be the first part of the
  name of <i>Shalmaneser</i>, and <i>Iareb</i>, or <i>Irib</i>, for it may
  be read both ways, the last part of the name of his successor
  <i>Sennacherib</i>: but whoever these Princes were, it appears not that
  they Reigned before <i>Shalmaneser</i>. <i>Pul</i>, or <i>Belus</i>,
  seems to be the first who carried on his conquests beyond the province of
  <i>Assyria</i>: he conquered <i>Calneh</i> with its territories in the
  Reign of <i>Jerboam</i>, <i>Amos</i> i. 1. vi. 2. &amp; <i>Isa.</i> x. 8,
  9. and invaded <i>Israel</i> in the Reign of <i>Menahem</i>, 2
  <i>King.</i> xv. 19. but stayed not in the land, being bought off by
  <i>Menahem</i> for a thousand talents of silver: in his Reign therefore
  the Kingdom of <i>Assyria</i> was advanced on this side <i>Tigris</i>:
  for he was a great warrior, and seems to have conquered <i>Haran</i>, and
  <i>Carchemish</i>, and <i>Reseph</i>, and <i>Calneh</i>, and
  <i>Thelasar</i>, and might found or enlarge the city of <i>Babylon</i>,
  and build the old palace.</p>

  <p><i>Herodotus</i> tells us, that one of the gates of <i>Babylon</i> was
  <a name="NtA_356" href="#Nt_356"><sup>[356]</sup></a> called the gate of
  <i>Semiramis</i>, and than she adorned the walls of the city, and the
  Temple of <i>Belus</i>, and that she <a name="NtA_357"
  href="#Nt_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a> was five Generations older than
  <i>Nitocris</i> the mother of <i>Labynitus</i>, or <i>Nabonnedus</i>, the
  last King of <i>Babylon</i>; and therefore she flourished four
  Generations, or about 134 years, before <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> , and by
  consequence in the Reign of <i>Tiglath-pileser</i> the successor of
  <i>Pul</i>: and the followers of <i>Ctesias</i> tell us, that she built
  <i>Babylon</i>, and was the widow of the son and successor of
  <i>Belus</i>, the founder of the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire; that is, the
  widow of one of the sons of <i>Pul</i>: but <a name="NtA_358"
  href="#Nt_358"><sup>[358]</sup></a> <i>Berosus</i> a <i>Chaldæan</i>
  blames the <i>Greeks</i> for ascribing the building of <i>Babylon</i> to
  <i>Semiramis</i>; and other authors ascribe the building of this city to
  <i>Belus</i> himself, that is to <i>Pul</i>; so <i>Curtius</i> <a
  name="NtA_359" href="#Nt_359"><sup>[359]</sup></a> tells us; <i>Semiramis
  Babylonem condiderat, vel ut plerique credidere Belus, cujus regia

      <p><i>The ancient city </i>Babylon<i> built by the </i>Tyrian Belus;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That is, by the <i>Syrian</i> or <i>Assyrian</i> <i>Belus</i>; the
  words <i>Tyrian</i>, <i>Syrian</i>, and <i>Assyrian</i>, being anciently
  used promiscuously for one another: <i>Herennius</i> <a name="NtA_362"
  href="#Nt_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a> tells us, that it was built by the
  son of <i>Belus</i>; and this son might be <i>Nabonassar</i>. After the
  conquest of <i>Calneh</i>, <i>Thelasar</i>, and <i>Sippare</i>,
  <i>Belus</i> might seize <i>Chaldæa</i>, and begin to build
  <i>Babylon</i>, and leave it to his younger son: for all the Kings of
  <i>Babylon</i> in the Canon of <i>Ptolemy</i> are called
  <i>Assyrians</i>, and <i>Nabonassar</i> is the first of them: and
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> <a name="NtA_363"
  href="#Nt_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a> reckoned himself descended from
  <i>Belus</i>, that is, from the <i>Assyrian</i> <i>Pul</i>: and the
  building of <i>Babylon</i> is ascribed to the <i>Assyrians</i> by <a
  name="NtA_364" href="#Nt_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a> <i>Isaiah</i>:
  <i>Behold</i>, saith he, <i>the land of the </i>Chaldeans<i>: This people
  was not 'till the </i>Assyrian<i> founded it for them that dwell in the
  wilderness, </i>[that is, for the <i>Arabians</i>.]<i> They set up the
  towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof</i>. From all this it
  seems therefore that <i>Pul</i> founded the walls and the palaces of
  <i>Babylon</i>, and left the city with the province of <i>Chaldæa</i> to
  his younger son <i>Nabonassar</i>; and that <i>Nabonassar</i> finished
  what his father began, and erected the Temple of <i>Jupiter Belus</i> to
  his father: and that <i>Semiramis</i> lived in those days, and was the
  Queen of <i>Nabonassar</i>, because one of the gates of <i>Babylon</i>
  was called the gate of <i>Semiramis</i>, as <i>Herodotus</i> affirms: but
  whether she continued to Reign there after her husband's death may be
  doubted.</p>

  <p><i>Pul</i> therefore was succeeded at <i>Nineveh</i> by his elder son
  <i>Tiglath-pileser</i>, at the same time that he left <i>Babylon</i> to
  his younger son <i>Nabonassar</i>. <i>Tiglath-pileser</i>, the second
  King of <i>Assyria</i>, warred in <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, and captivated
  <i>Galilee</i> with the two Tribes and an half, in the days of
  <i>Pekah</i> King of <i>Israel</i>, and placed them in <i>Halah</i>, and
  <i>Habor</i>, and <i>Hara</i>, and at the river <i>Gozan</i>, places
  lying on the western borders of <i>Media</i>, between <i>Assyria</i> and
  the <i>Caspian</i> sea, 2 <i>King.</i> xv. 29, &amp;: 1 <i>Chron.</i> v.
  26. and about the fifth or sixth year of <i>Nabonassar</i>, he came to
  the assistance of the King of <i>Judah</i> against the Kings of
  <i>Israel</i> and <i>Syria</i>, and overthrew the Kingdom of
  <i>Syria</i>, which had been seated at <i>Damascus</i> ever since the
  days of King <i>David</i>, and carried away the <i>Syrians</i> to
  <i>Kir</i> in <i>Media</i>, as <i>Amos</i> had prophesied, and placed
  other nations in the regions of <i>Damascus</i>, 2 <i>King.</i> xv. 37,
  &amp; xvi. 5, 9. <i>Amos</i> i. 5. <i>Joseph. Antiq.</i> l. 9. c. 13.
  whence it seems that the <i>Medes</i> were conquered before, and that the
  Empire of the <i>Assyrians</i> was now grown great: for <i>the God of
  </i>Israel<i> stirred up the spirit of </i>Pul<i> King of </i>Assyria<i>,
  and the spirit of </i>Tiglath-pileser<i> King of </i>Assyria to make war,
  1 <i>Chron.</i> v. 26.</p>

  <p><i>Shalmaneser</i> or <i>Salmanasser</i>, called <i>Enemessar</i> by
  <i>Tobit</i>, invaded <a name="NtA_365"
  href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a> all <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, took the
  city of <i>Samaria</i>, and captivated <i>Israel</i>, and placed them in
  <i>Chalach</i> and <i>Chabor</i>, by the river <i>Gozan</i>, and in the
  cities of the <i>Medes</i>; and <i>Hosea</i> <a name="NtA_366"
  href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> seems to say that he took
  <i>Arbela</i>: and his successor <i>Sennacherib</i> said that his fathers
  had conquered also <i>Gozan</i>, and <i>Haran</i> or <i>Carrhæ</i>, and
  <i>Reseph</i> or <i>Resen</i>, and the children of <i>Eden</i>, and
  <i>Arpad</i> or the <i>Aradii</i>, 2 <i>King.</i> xix. 12.</p>

  <p><i>Sennacherib</i> the son of <i>Shalmaneser</i> in the 14th year of
  <i>Hezekiah</i> invaded <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, and took several cities of
  <i>Judah</i>, and attempted <i>Egypt</i>; and <i>Sethon</i> or
  <i>Sevechus</i> King of <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Tirhakah</i> King of
  <i>Ethiopia</i> coming against him, he lost in one night 185000 men, as
  some say by a plague, or perhaps by lightning, or a fiery wind which
  blows sometimes in the neighbouring deserts, or rather by being surprised
  by <i>Sethon</i> and <i>Tirhakah</i>: for the <i>Egyptians</i> in memory
  of this action erected a statue to <i>Sethon</i>, holding in his hand a
  mouse, the <i>Egyptian</i> symbol of destruction. Upon this defeat
  <i>Sennacherib</i> returned in haste to <i>Nineveh</i>, and <a
  name="NtA_367" href="#Nt_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> his Kingdom became
  troubled, so that <i>Tobit</i> could not go into <i>Media</i>, the
  <i>Medes</i> I think at this time revolting: and he was soon after slain
  by two of his sons who fled into <i>Armenia</i>, and his son
  <i>Asserhadon</i> succeeded him. At that time did <i>Merodach Baladan</i>
  or <i>Mardocempad</i> King of <i>Babylon</i> send an embassy to
  <i>Hezekiah</i> King of <i>Judah</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Asserhadon</i>, <a name="NtA_368"
  href="#Nt_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> called <i>Sarchedon</i> by
  <i>Tobit</i>, <i>Asordan</i> by the LXX, and <i>Assaradin</i> in
  <i>Ptolomy</i>'s Canon, began his Reign at <i>Nineveh</i>, in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 42; and in the year 68 extended it over <i>Babylon</i>:
  then he carried the remainder of the <i>Samaritans</i> into captivity,
  and peopled <i>Samaria</i> with captives brought from several parts of
  his Kingdom, the <i>Dinaites</i>, the <i>Apharsachites</i>, the
  <i>Tarpelites</i>, the <i>Apharsites</i>, the <i>Archevites</i>, the
  <i>Babylonians</i>, the <i>Susanchites</i>, the <i>Dehavites</i>, the
  <i>Elamites</i>, <i>Ezra</i> iv. 2, 9. and therefore he Reigned over all
  these nations. <i>Pekah</i> and <i>Rezin</i> Kings of <i>Samaria</i> and
  <i>Damascus</i>, invaded <i>Judæa</i> in the first year of <i>Ahaz</i>,
  and within 65 years after, that is in the 21st year of <i>Manasseh</i>,
  <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 69, <i>Samaria</i> by this captivity ceased to be a
  people, <i>Isa.</i> vii. 8. Then <i>Asserhadon</i> invaded <i>Judæa</i>,
  took <i>Azoth</i>, carried <i>Manasseh</i> captive to <i>Babylon</i>, and
  <a name="NtA_369" href="#Nt_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> captivated also
  <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Thebais</i>, and <i>Ethiopia</i> above <i>Thebais</i>:
  and by this war he seems to have put an end to the Reign of the
  <i>Ethiopians</i> over <i>Egypt</i>, in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 77
  or 78.</p>

  <p>In the Reign of <i>Sennacherib</i> and <i>Asserhadon</i>, the
  <i>Assyrian</i> Empire seems arrived at its greatness, being united under
  one Monarch, and containing <i>Assyria</i>, <i>Media</i>,
  <i>Apolloniatis</i>, <i>Susiana</i>, <i>Chaldæa</i>, <i>Mesopotamia</i>,
  <i>Cilicia</i>, <i>Syria</i>, <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, <i>Egypt</i>,
  <i>Ethiopia</i>, and part of <i>Arabia</i>, and reaching eastward into
  <i>Elymais</i>, and <i>Parætacene</i>, a province of the <i>Medes</i>:
  and if <i>Chalach</i> and <i>Chabor</i> be <i>Colchis</i> and
  <i>Iberia</i>, as some think, and as may seem probable from the
  circumcision used by those nations 'till the days of <i>Herodotus</i>, we
  are also to add these two Provinces, with the two <i>Armenia's</i>,
  <i>Pontus</i> and <i>Cappadocia</i>, as far as to the river <i>Halys</i>:
  for <a name="NtA_370" href="#Nt_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a>
  <i>Herodotus</i> tells us, that the people of <i>Cappadocia</i> as far as
  to that river were called <i>Syrians</i> by the <i>Greeks</i>, both
  before and after the days or <i>Cyrus</i>, and that the <i>Assyrians</i>
  were also called <i>Syrians</i> by the <i>Greeks</i>.</p>

  <p>Yet the <i>Medes</i> revolted from the <i>Assyrians</i> in the latter
  end of the Reign of <i>Sennacherib</i>, I think upon the slaughter of his
  army near <i>Egypt</i> and his flight to <i>Nineveh</i>: for at that time
  the estate of <i>Sennacherib</i> was troubled, so that <i>Tobit</i> could
  not go into <i>Media</i> as he had done before, <i>Tobit</i> i. 15. and
  some time after, <i>Tobit</i> advised his son to go into <i>Media</i>
  where he might expect peace, while <i>Nineveh</i>, according to the
  prophesy of <i>Jonah</i>, should be destroyed. <i>Ctesias</i> wrote that
  <i>Arbaces</i> a <i>Mede</i> being admitted to see <i>Sardanapalus</i> in
  his palace, and observing his voluptuous life amongst women, revolted
  with the <i>Medes</i>, and in conjunction with <i>Belesis</i> a
  <i>Babylonian</i> overcame him, and caused him to set fire to his palace
  and burn himself: but he is contradicted by other authors of better
  credit; for <i>Duris</i> and <a name="NtA_371"
  href="#Nt_371"><sup>[371]</sup></a> many others wrote that <i>Arbaces</i>
  upon being admitted into the palace of <i>Sardanapalus</i>, and seeing
  his effeminate life, slew himself; and <i>Cleitarchus</i>, that
  <i>Sardanapalus</i> died of old age, after he had lost his dominion over
  <i>Syria</i>: he lost it by the revolt of the western nations; and
  <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_372" href="#Nt_372"><sup>[372]</sup></a>
  tells us, that the <i>Medes</i> revolted first, and defended their
  liberty by force of arms against the <i>Assyrians</i>, without conquering
  them; and at their first revolting had no King, but after some time set
  up <i>Dejoces</i> over them, and built <i>Ecbatane</i> for his residence;
  and that <i>Dejoces</i> Reigned only over <i>Media</i>, and had a
  peaceable Reign of 54 years, but his son and successor <i>Phraortes</i>
  made war upon his neighbours, and conquered <i>Persia</i>; and that the
  <i>Syrians</i> also, and other western nations, at length revolted from
  the <i>Assyrians</i>, being encouraged thereunto by the example of the
  <i>Medes</i>; and that after the revolt of the western nations,
  <i>Phraortes</i> invaded the <i>Assyrians</i>, but was slain by them in
  that war, after he had Reigned twenty and two years. He was succeeded by
  <i>Astyages</i>.</p>

  <p>Now <i>Asserhadon</i> seems to be the <i>Sardanapalus</i> who died of
  old age after the revolt of <i>Syria</i>, the name <i>Sardanapalus</i>
  being derived from <i>Asserhadon-Pul</i>. <i>Sardanapalus</i> was the <a
  name="NtA_373" href="#Nt_373"><sup>[373]</sup></a> son of
  <i>Anacyndaraxis</i>, <i>Cyndaraxis</i>, or <i>Anabaxaris</i>, King of
  <i>Assyria</i>; and this name seems to have been corruptly written for
  <i>Sennacherib</i> the father of <i>Asserhadon</i>. <i>Sardanapalus</i>
  built <i>Tarsus</i> and <i>Anchiale</i> in one day, and therefore Reigned
  over <i>Cilicia</i>, before the revolt of the western nations: and if he
  be the same King with <i>Asserhadon</i>, he was succeeded by
  <i>Saosduchinus</i> in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 81; and by this
  revolution <i>Manasseh</i> was set at liberty to return home and fortify
  <i>Jerusalem</i>: and the <i>Egyptians</i> also, after the
  <i>Assyrians</i> had harrassed <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Ethiopia</i> three
  years, <i>Isa.</i> xx. 3, 4. were set at liberty, and continued under
  twelve contemporary Kings of their own nation, as above. The
  <i>Assyrians</i> invaded and conquered the <i>Egyptians</i> the first of
  the three years, and Reigned over them two years more: and these two
  years are the interregnum which <i>Africanus</i>, from <i>Manetho</i>,
  places next before the twelve Kings. The <i>Scythians</i> of
  <i>Touran</i> or <i>Turquestan</i> beyond the river <i>Oxus</i> began in
  those days to infest <i>Persia</i>, and by one of their inroads might
  give occasion to the revolt of the western nations.</p>

  <p>In the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 101, <i>Saosduchinus</i>, after a
  Reign of twenty years, was succeeded at <i>Babylon</i> by
  <i>Chyniladon</i>, and I think at <i>Nineveh</i> also, for I take
  <i>Chyniladon</i> to be that <i>Nabuchodonosor</i> who is mentioned in
  the book of <i>Judith</i>; for the history of that King suits best with
  these times: for there it is said that Nabuchodonosor<i> King of the
  </i>Assyrians<i> who Reigned at </i>Nineveh<i>, that great city, in the
  twelfth year of his Reign made war upon </i>Arphaxad<i> King of the
  </i>Medes, and was then left alone by a defection of the auxiliary
  nations of <i>Cilicia</i>, <i>Damascus</i>, <i>Syria</i>,
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, <i>Moab</i>, <i>Ammon</i>, and <i>Egypt</i>; and
  without their help routed the army of the <i>Medes</i>, and slew
  <i>Arphaxad</i>: and <i>Arphaxad</i> is there said to have built
  <i>Ecbatane</i> and therefore was either <i>Dejoces</i>, or his son
  <i>Phraortes</i>, who might finish the city founded by his father: and
  <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_374" href="#Nt_374"><sup>[374]</sup></a>
  tells the same story of a King of <i>Assyria</i>, who routed the
  <i>Medes</i>, and slew their King <i>Phraortes</i>; and saith that in the
  time of this war the <i>Assyrians</i> were left alone by the defection of
  the auxiliary nations, being otherwise in good condition: <i>Arphaxad</i>
  was therefore the <i>Phraortes</i> of <i>Herodotus</i>, and by
  consequence was slain near the beginning of the Reign of <i>Josiah</i>:
  for this war was made after <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, <i>Moab</i>,
  <i>Ammon</i>, and <i>Egypt</i> had been conquered and revolted,
  <i>Judith</i> i. 7, 8, 9. and by consequence after the Reign of
  <i>Asserhadon</i> who conquered them: it was made when the <i>Jews</i>
  were newly returned from captivity, <i>and the Vessels and Altar and
  Temple were sanctified after the profanation</i>, <i>Judith</i> iv. 3.
  that is soon after <i>Manasseh</i> their King had been carried captive to
  <i>Babylon</i> by <i>Asserhadon</i>; and upon the death of that King, or
  some other change in the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire, had been released with
  the <i>Jews</i> from that captivity, and had repaired the Altar, and
  restored the sacrifices and worship of the Temple, 2 <i>Chron.</i>
  xxxiii. 11, 16. In the <i>Greek</i> version of the book of <i>Judith</i>,
  chap. v. 18. it is said, that <i>the Temple of God was cast to the
  ground</i>; but this is not said in <i>Jerom</i>'s version; and in the
  <i>Greek</i> version, chap. iv. 3, and chap. xvi. 20, it is said, that
  <i>the vessels, and the altar, and the house were sanctified after the
  prophanation</i>, and in both versions, chap. iv. 11, the Temple is
  represented standing.</p>

  <p>After this war <i>Nabuchodonosor</i> King of <i>Assyria</i>, in the
  13th year of his Reign, according to the version of <i>Jerom</i>, sent
  his captain <i>Holofernes</i> with a great army to avenge himself on all
  the west country; because they had disobeyed his commandment: and
  <i>Holofernes</i> went forth with an army of 12000 horse, and 120000 foot
  of <i>Assyrians</i>, <i>Medes</i> and <i>Persians</i>, and reduced
  <i>Cilicia</i>, <i>Mesopotamia</i>, and <i>Syria</i>, and
  <i>Damascus</i>, and part of <i>Arabia</i>, and <i>Ammon</i>, and
  <i>Edom</i>, and <i>Madian</i>, and then came against <i>Judæa</i>: and
  this was done when the government was in the hands of the High-Priest and
  Antients of <i>Israel</i>, <i>Judith</i> iv. 8. and vii. 23. and by
  consequence not in the Reign of <i>Manasseh</i> or <i>Amon</i>, but when
  <i>Josiah</i> was a child. In times of prosperity the children of
  <i>Israel</i> were apt to go after false Gods, and in times of affliction
  to repent and turn to the Lord. So <i>Manasseh</i> a very wicked King,
  being captivated by the <i>Assyrians</i>, repented; and being released
  from captivity restored the worship of the true God: So when we are told
  that <i>Josiah in the eighth year of his Reign, while he was yet young,
  began to seek after the God of </i>David<i> his father, and in the
  twelfth year of his Reign began to purge </i>Judah<i> and
  </i>Jerusalem<i> from Idolatry, and to destroy the High Places, and
  Groves, and Altars and Images of Baalim</i>, 2 <i>Chron</i>. xxxiv. 3. we
  may understand that these acts of religion were occasioned by impending
  dangers, and escapes from danger. When <i>Holofernes</i> came against the
  western nations, and spoiled them, then were the <i>Jews</i> terrified,
  and they fortified <i>Judæa</i>, and <i>cryed unto God with great
  fervency, and humbled themselves in sackcloth, and put ashes on their
  heads, and cried unto the God of </i>Israel<i> that he would not give
  their wives and their children and cities for a prey, and the Temple for
  a profanation: and the High-priest, and all the Priests put on sackcloth
  and ashes, and offered daily burnt offerings with vows and free gifts of
  the people</i>, <i>Judith</i> iv. and then began <i>Josiah</i> to seek
  after the God of his father <i>David</i>: and after <i>Judith</i> had
  slain <i>Holofernes</i>, and the <i>Assyrians</i> were fled, and the
  <i>Jews</i> who pursued them were returned to <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>they
  worshipped the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and gifts, and continued
  feasting before the sanctuary for the space of three months</i>,
  <i>Judith</i> xvi. 18, and then did <i>Josiah</i> purge <i>Judah</i> and
  <i>Jerusalem</i> from Idolatry. Whence it seems to me that the eighth
  year of <i>Josiah</i> fell in with the fourteenth or fifteenth of
  <i>Nabuchodonosor</i>, and that the twelfth year of
  <i>Nabuchodonosor</i>, in which <i>Phraortes</i> was slain, was the fifth
  or sixth of <i>Josiah</i>. <i>Phraortes</i> Reigned 22 years according to
  <i>Herodotus</i>, and therefore succeeded his father <i>Dejoces</i> about
  the 40th year of <i>Manasseh</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 89, and was slain
  by the <i>Assyrians</i>, and succeeded by <i>Astyages</i>, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 111. <i>Dejoces</i> Reigned 53 years according to
  <i>Herodotus</i>, and these years began in the 16th year of
  <i>Hezekiah</i>; which makes it probable that the <i>Medes</i> dated them
  from the time of their revolt: and according to all this reckoning, the
  Reign of <i>Nabuchodonosor</i> fell in with that of <i>Chyniladon</i>;
  which makes it probable that they were but two names of one and the same
  King.</p>

  <p>Soon after the death of <i>Phraortes</i> <a name="NtA_375"
  href="#Nt_375"><sup>[375]</sup></a> the <i>Scythians</i> under
  <i>Madyes</i> or <i>Medus</i> invaded <i>Media</i>, and beat the
  <i>Medes</i> in battle, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 113, and went thence
  towards <i>Egypt</i>, but were met in <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> by
  <i>Psammitichus</i> and bought off, and returning Reigned over a great
  part of <i>Asia</i>: but in the end of about 28 years were expelled; many
  of their Princes and commanders being slain in a feast by the
  <i>Medes</i> under the conduct of <i>Cyaxeres</i>, the successor of
  <i>Astyages</i>, just before the destruction of <i>Nineveh</i>, and the
  rest being soon after forced to retire.</p>

  <p>In the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 123, <a name="NtA_376"
  href="#Nt_376"><sup>[376]</sup></a> <i>Nabopolassar</i> the commander of
  the forces of <i>Chyniladon</i> the King of <i>Assyria</i> in
  <i>Chaldæa</i> revolted from him, and became King of <i>Babylon</i>; and
  <i>Chyniladon</i> was either then, or soon after, succeeded at
  <i>Nineveh</i> by the last King of <i>Assyria</i>, called <i>Sarac</i> by
  <i>Polyhistor</i>: and at length <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, the son of
  <i>Nabopolassar</i>, married <i>Amyite</i> the daughter of
  <i>Astyages</i> and sister of <i>Cyaxeres</i>; and by this marriage the
  two families having contracted affinity, they conspired against the
  <i>Assyrians</i>; and <i>Nabopolasser</i> being now grown old, and
  <i>Astyages</i> being dead, their sons <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and
  <i>Cyaxeres</i> led the armies of the two nations against <i>Nineveh</i>,
  slew <i>Sarac</i>, destroyed the city, and shared the Kingdom of the
  <i>Assyrians</i>. This victory the <i>Jews</i> refer to the
  <i>Chaldæans</i>; the <i>Greeks</i> to the <i>Medes</i>; <i>Tobit</i>,
  <i>Polyhistor</i>, <i>Josephus</i>, and <i>Ctesias</i> to both. It gave a
  beginning to the great successes of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and
  <i>Cyaxeres</i>, and laid the foundation of the two collateral Empires of
  the <i>Babylonians</i> and <i>Medes</i>; these being branches of the
  <i>Assyrian</i> Empire: and thence the time of the fall of the
  <i>Assyrian</i> Empire is determined, the conquerors being then in their
  youth. In the Reign of <i>Josiah</i>, when <i>Zephaniah</i> prophesied,
  <i>Nineveh</i> and the Kingdom of <i>Assyria</i> were standing, and their
  fall was predicted by that Prophet, <i>Zeph.</i> i. 1, and ii. 13. and in
  the end of his Reign <i>Pharaoh Nechoh</i> King of <i>Egypt</i>, the
  successor of <i>Psammitichus</i>, went up against the King of
  <i>Assyria</i> to the river <i>Euphrates</i>, to fight against
  <i>Carchemish</i> or <i>Circutium</i>, and in his way thither slew
  <i>Josiah</i>, 2 <i>Kings</i> xxiii. 29. 2 <i>Chron.</i> xxxv. 20. and
  therefore the last King of <i>Assyria</i> was not yet slain. But in the
  third and fourth year of <i>Jehoiakim</i> the successor of <i>Josiah</i>,
  the two conquerors having taken <i>Nineveh</i> and finished their war in
  <i>Assyria</i>, prosecuted their conquests westward, and leading their
  forces against the King of <i>Egypt</i>, as an invader of their right of
  conquest, they beat him at <i>Carchemish</i>, and <a name="NtA_377"
  href="#Nt_377"><sup>[377]</sup></a> took from him whatever he had newly
  taken from the <i>Assyrians</i>: and therefore we cannot err above a year
  or two, if we refer the destruction of <i>Nineveh</i>, and fall of the
  <i>Assyrian</i> Empire, to the second year of <i>Jehoiakim</i>, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 140. The name of the last King <i>Sarac</i> might perhaps
  be contracted from <i>Sarchedon</i>, as this name was from
  <i>Asserhadon</i>, <i>Asserhadon-Pul</i>, or <i>Sardanapalus</i>.</p>

  <p>While the <i>Assyrians</i> Reigned at <i>Nineveh</i>, <i>Persia</i>
  was divided into several Kingdoms; and amongst others there was a Kingdom
  of <i>Elam</i>, which flourished in the days of <i>Hezekiah</i>,
  <i>Manasseh</i>, <i>Josiah</i>, and <i>Jehoiakim</i> Kings of
  <i>Judah</i>, and fell in the days of <i>Zedekiah</i>, <i>Jer.</i> xxv.
  25, and xlix. 34, and <i>Ezek.</i> xxxii. 24. This Kingdom seems to have
  been potent, and to have had wars with the King of <i>Touran</i> or
  <i>Scythia</i> beyond the river <i>Oxus</i> with various success, and at
  length to have been subdued by the <i>Medes</i> and <i>Babylonians</i>,
  or one of them. For while <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> warred in the west,
  <i>Cyaxeres</i> recovered the <i>Assyrian</i> provinces of
  <i>Armenia</i>, <i>Pontus</i>, and <i>Cappadocia</i>, and then they went
  eastward against the provinces of <i>Persia</i> and <i>Parthia</i>.
  Whether the <i>Pischdadians</i>, whom the <i>Persians</i> reckon to have
  been their oldest Kings, were Kings of the Kingdom of <i>Elam</i>, or of
  that of the <i>Assyrians</i>, and whether <i>Elam</i> was conquered by
  the <i>Assyrians</i> at the same time with <i>Babylonia</i> and
  <i>Susiana</i> in the Reign of <i>Asserhadon</i>, and soon after
  revolted, I leave to be examined.</p>

<h2>CHAP. IV.</h2>

<h3><i>Of the two Contemporary Empires of
the </i>Babylonians<i> and </i>Medes<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>By the fall of the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire the Kingdoms of the
  <i>Babylonians</i> and <i>Medes</i> grew great and potent. The Reigns of
  the Kings of <i>Babylon</i> are stated in <i>Ptolemy's</i> Canon: for
  understanding of which you are to note that every King's Reign in that
  Canon began with the last <i>Thoth</i> of his predecessor's Reign, as I
  gather by comparing the Reigns of the <i>Roman</i> Emperors in that Canon
  with their Reigns recorded in years, months, and days, by other Authors:
  whence it appears from that Canon that <i>Asserhadon</i> died in the year
  of <i>Nabonassar</i> 81, <i>Saosduchinus</i> his successor in the year
  101, <i>Chyniladon</i> in the year 123, <i>Nabopolassar</i> in the year
  144, and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> in the year 187. All these Kings, and some
  others mentioned in the Canon, Reigned successively over <i>Babylon</i>,
  and this last King died in the 37th year of <i>Jechoniah</i>'s captivity,
  2 <i>Kings</i> xxv. 27. and therefore <i>Jechoniah</i> was captivated in
  the 150th year of <i>Nabonassar</i>.</p>

  <p>This captivity was in the eighth year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>'s
  Reign, 2 <i>Kings</i> xxiv. 12. and eleventh of <i>Jehoiakim</i>'s: for
  the first year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>'s Reign was the fourth of
  <i>Jehoiakim</i>'s, <i>Jer.</i> xxv. i. and <i>Jehoiakim</i> Reigned
  eleven years before this captivity, 2 <i>Kings</i> xxiii. 36. 2
  <i>Chron.</i> xxxvi. 5, and <i>Jechoniah</i> three months, ending with
  the captivity; and the tenth year of <i>Jechoniah</i>'s captivity, was
  the eighteenth year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>'s Reign, <i>Jer.</i> xxxii.
  1. and the eleventh year of <i>Zedekiah</i>, in which <i>Jerusalem</i>
  was taken, was the nineteenth of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, <i>Jer.</i> lii.
  5, 12. and therefore <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> began his Reign in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 142, that is, two years before the death of his father
  <i>Nabopolassar</i>, he being then made King by his father; and
  <i>Jehoiakim</i> succeeded his father <i>Josiah</i> in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 139; and <i>Jerusalem</i> was taken and the Temple
  burnt in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 160, about twenty years after the
  destruction of <i>Nineveh</i>.</p>

  <p>The Reign of <i>Darius Hystaspis</i> over <i>Persia</i>, by the Canon
  and the consent of all Chronologers, and by several Eclipses of the Moon,
  began in spring in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 227: and <i>in the
  fourth year of King </i>Darius<i>, in the 4th day of the ninth month,
  which is the month </i>Chisleu<i>, when the </i>Jews<i> had sent unto the
  house of God, saying, should I weep in the fifth month as I have done
  these so many years? the word of the Lord came unto </i>Zechariah<i>,
  saying, speak to all the people of the Land, and to the Priests, saying;
  when ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month even those
  seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me?</i> <i>Zech.</i> vii. Count
  backwards those seventy years in which they fasted in the fifth month for
  the burning of the Temple, and in the seventh for the death of
  <i>Gedaliah</i>; and the burning of the Temple and death of
  <i>Gedaliah</i>, will fall upon the fifth and seventh <i>Jewish</i>
  months, in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 160, as above.</p>

  <p>As the <i>Chaldæan</i> Astronomers counted the Reigns of their Kings
  by the years of <i>Nabonassar</i>, beginning with the month <i>Thoth</i>,
  so the <i>Jews</i>, as their Authors tell us, counted the Reigns of
  theirs by the years of <i>Moses</i>, beginning every year with the month
  <i>Nisan</i>: for if any King began his Reign a few days before this
  month began, it was reckoned to him for a whole year, and the beginning
  of this month was accounted the beginning of the second year of his
  Reign; and according to this reckoning the first year of <i>Jehojakim</i>
  began with the month <i>Nisan</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 139, tho' his
  Reign might not really begin 'till five or six months after; and the
  fourth year of <i>Jehoiakim</i>, and first of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>,
  according to the reckoning of the <i>Jews</i>, began with the month
  <i>Nisan</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 142; and the first year of
  <i>Zedekiah</i> and of <i>Jeconiah</i>'s captivity, and ninth year of
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, began with the month <i>Nisan</i>, in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 150; and the tenth year of <i>Zedekiah</i>, and 18th of
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, began with the month <i>Nisan</i> in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 159. Now in the ninth year of <i>Zedekiah</i>,
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> invaded <i>Judæa</i> and the cities thereof and in
  the tenth month of that year, and tenth day of the month, he and his host
  besieged <i>Jerusalem</i>, 2 <i>Kings</i> xxv. 1. <i>Jer.</i> xxxiv. 1,
  xxxix. 1, and lii. 4. From this time to the tenth month in the second
  year of <i>Darius</i> are just seventy years, and accordingly, <i>upon
  the 24th day of the eleventh month of the second year of </i>Darius<i>,
  the word of the Lord came unto </i>Zechariah<i>,&mdash;and the Angel of
  the Lord said, Oh Lord of Hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on
  </i>Jerusalem<i>, and on the cities of </i>Judah<i>, against which thou
  hast had indignation, these threescore and ten years</i>, <i>Zech.</i> i.
  7, 12. So then the ninth year of <i>Zedekiah</i>, in which this
  indignation against <i>Jerusalem</i> and the cities of <i>Judah</i>
  began, commenced with the month <i>Nisan</i> in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 158; and the eleventh year of <i>Zedekiah</i>, and
  nineteenth of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, in which the city was taken and the
  Temple burnt, commenced with the month <i>Nisan</i> in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 160, as above.</p>

  <p>By all these characters the years of <i>Jehoiakim</i>,
  <i>Zedekiah</i>, and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, seem to be sufficiently
  determined, and thereby the Chronology of the <i>Jews</i> in the Old
  Testament is connected with that of later times: for between the death of
  <i>Solomon</i> and the ninth year of <i>Zedekiah</i> wherein
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> invaded <i>Judæa</i>, and began the Siege of
  <i>Jerusalem</i>, there were 390 years, as is manifest both by the
  prophesy of <i>Ezekiel</i>, chap. iv, and by summing up the years of the
  Kings of <i>Judah</i>; and from the ninth year of <i>Zedekiah</i>
  inclusively to the vulgar <i>Æra</i> of <i>Christ</i>, there were 590
  years: and both these numbers, with half the Reign of <i>Solomon</i>,
  make up a thousand years.</p>

  <p>In the <a name="NtA_378" href="#Nt_378"><sup>[378]</sup></a> end of
  the Reign of <i>Josiah</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 139, <i>Pharaoh
  Nechoh</i>, the successor of <i>Psammitichus</i>, came with a great army
  out of <i>Egypt</i> against the King of <i>Assyria</i>, and being denied
  passage through <i>Judæa</i>, beat the <i>Jews</i> at <i>Megiddo</i> or
  <i>Magdolus</i> before <i>Egypt</i>, slew <i>Josiah</i> their King,
  marched to <i>Carchemish</i> or <i>Circutium</i>, a town of
  <i>Mesopotamia</i> upon <i>Euphrates</i>, and took it, possest himself of
  the cities of <i>Syria</i>, sent for <i>Jehoahaz</i> the new King of
  <i>Judah</i> to <i>Riblah</i> or <i>Antioch</i>, deposed him there, made
  <i>Jehojakim</i> King in the room of <i>Josiah</i>, and put the Kingdom
  of <i>Judah</i> to tribute: but the King of <i>Assyria</i> being in the
  mean time besieged and subdued, and <i>Nineveh</i> destroyed by
  <i>Assuerus</i> King of the <i>Medes</i>, and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> King
  of <i>Babylon</i>, and the conquerors being thereby entitled to the
  countries belonging to the King of <i>Assyria</i>, they led their
  victorious armies against the King of <i>Egypt</i> who had seized part of
  them. For <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, assisted <a name="NtA_379"
  href="#Nt_379"><sup>[379]</sup></a> by <i>Astibares</i>, that is, by
  <i>Astivares</i>, <i>Assuerus</i>, <i>Acksweres</i>, <i>Axeres</i>, or
  <i>Cy-Axeres</i>, King of the <i>Medes</i>, in the <a name="NtA_380"
  href="#Nt_380"><sup>[380]</sup></a> third year of <i>Jehoiakim</i>, came
  with an army of <i>Babylonians</i>, <i>Medes</i>, <i>Syrians</i>,
  <i>Moabites</i> and <i>Ammonites</i>, to the number of 10000 chariots,
  and 180000 foot, and 120000 horse, and laid waste <i>Samaria</i>,
  <i>Galilee</i>, <i>Scythopolis</i>, and the <i>Jews</i> in
  <i>Galaaditis</i>, and besieged <i>Jerusalem</i>, and took King
  <i>Jehoiakim</i> alive, and <a name="NtA_381"
  href="#Nt_381"><sup>[381]</sup></a> bound him in chains for a time, and
  carried to <i>Babylon</i> <i>Daniel</i> and others of the people, and
  part of what Gold and Silver and Brass they found in the Temple: and in
  <a name="NtA_382" href="#Nt_382"><sup>[382]</sup></a> the fourth year of
  <i>Jehoiakim</i>, which was the twentieth of <i>Nabopolassar</i>, they
  routed the army of <i>Pharaoh Nechoh</i> at <i>Carchemish</i>, and by
  pursuing the war took from the King of <i>Egypt</i> whatever pertained to
  him from the river of <i>Egypt</i> to the river of <i>Euphrates</i>. This
  King of <i>Egypt</i> is called by <i>Berosus</i>, <a name="NtA_383"
  href="#Nt_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a> the <i>Satrapa</i> of <i>Egypt</i>,
  <i>C&#339;le-Syria</i>, and <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>; and this victory over
  him put an end to his Reign in <i>C&#339;le-Syria</i> and
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, which he had newly invaded, and gave a beginning to
  the Reign of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> there: and by the conquests over
  <i>Assyria</i> and <i>Syria</i> the small Kingdom of <i>Babylon</i> was
  erected into a potent Empire.</p>

  <p>Whilst <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> was acting in <i>Syria</i>, <a
  name="NtA_384" href="#Nt_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a> his father
  <i>Nabopolassar</i> died, having Reigned 21 years; and
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> upon the news thereof, having ordered his affairs
  in <i>Syria</i> returned to <i>Babylon</i>, leaving the captives and his
  army with his servants to follow him: and from henceforward he applied
  himself sometimes to war, conquering <i>Sittacene</i>, <i>Susiana</i>,
  <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Edom</i>, <i>Egypt</i>, and some other countries; and
  sometimes to peace, adorning the Temple of <i>Belus</i> with the spoils
  that he had taken; and the city of <i>Babylon</i> with magnificent walls
  and gates, and stately palaces and pensile gardens, as <i>Berosus</i>
  relates; and amongst other things he cut the new rivers <i>Naarmalcha</i>
  and <i>Pallacopas</i> above <i>Babylon</i> and built the city of
  <i>Teredon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Judæa</i> was now in servitude under the King of <i>Babylon</i>,
  being invaded and subdued in the third and fourth years of
  <i>Jehoiakim</i>, <i>and </i>Jehoiakim<i> served him three years, and
  then turned and rebelled</i>, 2 <i>King.</i> xxiv. 1. While
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and the army of the <i>Chaldæans</i> continued in
  <i>Syria</i>, <i>Jehojakim</i> was under compulsion; after they returned
  to <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Jehojakim</i> continued in fidelity three years,
  that is, during the 7th, 8th and 9th years of his Reign, and rebelled in
  the tenth: whereupon in the return or end of the year, that is in spring,
  he sent <a name="NtA_385" href="#Nt_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a> and
  besieged <i>Jerusalem</i>, captivated <i>Jeconiah</i> the son and
  successor of <i>Jehoiakim</i>, spoiled the Temple, and carried away to
  <i>Babylon</i> the Princes, craftsmen, smiths, and all that were fit for
  war: and, when none remained but the poorest of the people, made <a
  name="NtA_386" href="#Nt_386"><sup>[386]</sup></a> <i>Zedekiah</i> their
  King, and bound him upon oath to serve the King of <i>Babylon</i>: this
  was in spring in the end of the eleventh year of <i>Jehoiakim</i>, and
  beginning of the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 150.</p>

  <p><i>Zedekiah</i> notwithstanding his oath <a name="NtA_387"
  href="#Nt_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a> revolted, and made a covenant with
  the King of <i>Egypt</i>, and therefore <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> in the
  ninth year of <i>Zedekiah</i> <a name="NtA_388"
  href="#Nt_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a> invaded <i>Judæa</i> and the cities
  thereof, and in the tenth <i>Jewish</i> month of that year besieged
  <i>Jerusalem</i> again, and in the eleventh year of <i>Zedekiah</i>, in
  the 4th and 5th months, after a siege of one year and an half, took and
  burnt the City and Temple.</p>

  <p><i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> after he was made King by his father Reigned
  over <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and <i>C&#339;le-Syria</i> 45 years, and <a
  name="NtA_389" href="#Nt_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a> after the death of his
  father 43 years, and <a name="NtA_390"
  href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> after the captivity of
  <i>Jeconiah</i> 37; and then was succeeded by his son
  <i>Evilmerodach</i>, called <i>Iluarodamus</i> in <i>Ptolemy</i>'s Canon.
  <i>Jerome</i> <a name="NtA_391" href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a> tells
  us, that <i>Evilmerodach</i> Reigned seven years in his father's
  life-time, while his father did eat grass with oxen, and after his
  father's restoration was put in prison with <i>Jeconiah</i> King of
  <i>Judah</i> 'till the death of his father, and then succeeded in the
  Throne. In the fifth year of <i>Jeconiah</i>'s captivity,
  <i>Belshazzar</i> was next in dignity to his father
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, and was designed to be his successor,
  <i>Baruch</i> i. 2, 10, 11, 12, 14, and therefore <i>Evilmerodach</i> was
  even then in disgrace. Upon his coming to the Throne <a name="NtA_392"
  href="#Nt_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a> he brought his friend and companion
  <i>Jeconiah</i> out of prison on the 27th day of the twelfth month; so
  that <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> died in the end of winter, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 187.</p>

  <p><i>Evilmerodach</i> Reigned two years after his father's death, and
  for his lust and evil manners was slain by his sister's husband
  <i>Neriglissar</i>, or <i>Nergalassar</i>, <i>Nabonass.</i> 189,
  according to the Canon.</p>

  <p><i>Neriglissar</i>, in the name of his young son <i>Labosordachus</i>,
  or <i>Laboasserdach</i>, the grand-child of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> by his
  daughter, Reigned four years, according to the Canon and <i>Berosus</i>,
  including the short Reign of <i>Laboasserdach</i> alone: for
  <i>Laboasserdach</i>, according to <i>Berosus</i> and <i>Josephus</i>,
  Reigned nine months after the death of his father, and then for his evil
  manners was slain in a feast, by the conspiracy of his friends with
  <i>Nabonnedus</i> a <i>Babylonian</i>, to whom by consent they gave the
  Kingdom: but these nine months are not reckoned apart in the Canon.</p>

  <p><i>Nabonnedus</i> or <i>Nabonadius</i>, according to the Canon, began
  his Reign in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 193, Reigned seventeen years,
  and ended his Reign in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 210, being then
  vanquished and <i>Babylon</i> taken by <i>Cyrus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Herodotus</i> calls this last King of <i>Babylon</i>,
  <i>Labynitus</i>, and says that he was the son of a former
  <i>Labynitus</i>, and of <i>Nitocris</i> an eminent Queen of
  <i>Babylon</i>: by the father he seems to understand that
  <i>Labynitus</i>, who, as he tells us, was King of <i>Babylon</i> when
  the great Eclipse of the Sun predicted by <i>Thales</i> put an end to the
  five years war between the <i>Medes</i> and <i>Lydians</i>; and this was
  the great <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>. <i>Daniel</i> <a name="NtA_393"
  href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a> calls the last King of
  <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Belshazzar</i>, and saith that <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>
  was his father: and <i>Josephus</i> tells us, <a name="NtA_394"
  href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> that the last King of <i>Babylon</i>
  was called <i>Naboandel</i> by the <i>Babylonians</i>, and Reigned
  seventeen years; and therefore he is the same King of <i>Babylon</i> with
  <i>Nabonnedus</i> or <i>Labynitus</i>; and this is more agreeable to
  sacred writ than to make <i>Nabonnedus</i> a stranger to the royal line:
  for all <i>nations were to serve </i>Nebuchadnezzar<i> and his posterity,
  till the very time of his land should come, and many nations should serve
  themselves of him</i>, <i>Jer.</i> xxvii. 7. <i>Belshazzar</i> was born
  and lived in honour before the fifth year of <i>Jeconiah</i>'s captivity,
  which was the eleventh year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>'s Reign; and
  therefore he was above 34 years old at the death of <i>Evilmerodach</i>,
  and so could be no other King than <i>Nabonnedus</i>: for
  <i>Laboasserdach</i> the grandson of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> was a child
  when he Reigned.</p>

  <p><i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_395" href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a>
  tells us, that there were two famous Queens of <i>Babylon</i>,
  <i>Semiramis</i> and <i>Nitocris</i>; and that the latter was more
  skilful: she observing that the Kingdom of the <i>Medes</i>, having
  subdued many cities, and among others <i>Nineveh</i>, was become great
  and potent, intercepted and fortified the passages out of <i>Media</i>
  into <i>Babylonia</i>; and the river which before was straight, she made
  crooked with great windings, that it might be more sedate and less apt to
  overflow: and on the side of the river above <i>Babylon</i>, in imitation
  of the Lake of <i>M&#339;ris</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, she dug a Lake every
  way forty miles broad, to receive the water of the river, and keep it for
  watering the land. She built also a bridge over the river in the middle
  of <i>Babylon</i>, turning the stream into the Lake 'till the bridge was
  built. <i>Philostratus</i> saith, <a name="NtA_396"
  href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> that she made a bridge under the
  river two fathoms broad, meaning an arched vault over which the river
  flowed, and under which they might walk cross the river: he calls her
  <span lang="el" title="Mêdeia"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B7;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>, a <i>Mede</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Berosus</i> tells us, that <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> built a pensile
  garden upon arches, because his wife was a <i>Mede</i> and delighted in
  mountainous prospects, such as abounded in <i>Media</i>, but were wanting
  in <i>Babylonia</i>: she was <i>Amyite</i> the daughter of
  <i>Astyages</i>, and sister of <i>Cyaxeres</i>, Kings of the
  <i>Medes</i>. <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> married her upon a league between the
  two families against the King of <i>Assyria</i>: but <i>Nitocris</i>
  might be another woman who in the Reign of her son <i>Labynitus</i>, a
  voluptuous and vicious King, took care of his affairs, and for securing
  his Kingdom against the <i>Medes</i>, did the works above mentioned. This
  is that Queen mentioned in <i>Daniel</i>, chap. v. ver. 10.</p>

  <p><i>Josephus</i> <a name="NtA_397" href="#Nt_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a>
  relates out of the <i>Tyrian</i> records, that in the Reign of
  <i>Ithobalus</i> King of <i>Tyre</i>, that city was besieged by
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> thirteen years together: in the end of that siege
  <i>Ithobalus</i> their King was slain, <i>Ezek.</i> xxviii. 8, 9, 10. and
  after him, according to the <i>Tyrian</i> records, Reigned <i>Baal</i>
  ten years, <i>Ecnibalus</i> and <i>Chelbes</i> one year, <i>Abbarus</i>
  three months, <i>Mytgonus</i> and <i>Gerastratus</i> six years,
  <i>Balatorus</i> one year, <i>Merbalus</i> four years, and <i>Iromus</i>
  twenty years: and in the fourteenth year of <i>Iromus</i>, say the
  <i>Tyrian</i> records, the Reign of <i>Cyrus</i> began in
  <i>Babylonia</i>; therefore the siege of <i>Tyre</i> began 48 years and
  some months before the Reign of <i>Cyrus</i> in <i>Babylonia</i>: it
  began when <i>Jerusalem</i> had been newly taken and burnt, with the
  Temple, <i>Ezek.</i> xxvi and by consequence after the eleventh year of
  <i>Jeconiah</i>'s captivity, or 160th year of <i>Nabonassar</i>, and
  therefore the Reign of <i>Cyrus</i> in <i>Babylonia</i> began after the
  year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 208: it ended before the eight and twentieth
  year of <i>Jeconiah</i>'s captivity, or 176th year of <i>Nabonassar</i>,
  <i>Ezek.</i> xxix. 17. and therefore the Reign of <i>Cyrus</i> in
  <i>Babylonia</i> began before the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 211. By this
  argument the first year of <i>Cyrus</i> in <i>Babylonia</i> was one of
  the two intermediate years 209, 210. <i>Cyrus</i> invaded
  <i>Babylonia</i> in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 209; <a name="NtA_398"
  href="#Nt_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> <i>Babylon</i> held out, and the next
  year was taken, <i>Jer.</i> li. 39, 57. by diverting the river
  <i>Euphrates</i>, and entring the city through the emptied channel, and
  by consequence after midsummer: for the river, by the melting of the snow
  in <i>Armenia</i>, overflows yearly in the beginning of summer, but in
  the heat of dimmer grows low. <a name="NtA_399"
  href="#Nt_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a> <i>And that night was the King of
  </i>Babylon<i> slain, and </i>Darius<i> the </i>Mede<i>, or King of the
  </i>Medes<i>, took the Kingdom being about threescore and two years
  old</i>: so then <i>Babylon</i> was taken a month or two after the summer
  solstice, in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 210; as the Canon also
  represents.</p>

  <p>The Kings of the <i>Medes</i> before <i>Cyrus</i> were <i>Dejoces</i>,
  <i>Phraortes</i>, <i>Astyages</i>, <i>Cyaxeres</i>, or <i>Cyaxares</i>,
  and <i>Darius</i>: the three first Reigned before the Kingdom grew great,
  the two last were great conquerors, and erected the Empire; for
  <i>Æschylus</i>, who flourished in the Reigns of <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>,
  and <i>Xerxes</i>, and died in the 76th Olympiad, introduces
  <i>Darius</i> thus complaining of those who persuaded his son
  <i>Xerxes</i> to invade <i>Greece</i>; <a name="NtA_400"

  <p>The Poet here attributes the founding of the <i>Medo-Persian</i>
  Empire to the two immediate predecessors of <i>Cyrus</i>, the first of
  which was a <i>Mede</i>, and the second was his son: the second was
  <i>Darius</i> the <i>Mede</i>, the immediate predecessor of <i>Cyrus</i>,
  according to <i>Daniel</i>; and therefore the first was the father of
  <i>Darius</i>, that is, <i>Achsuerus</i>, <i>Assuerus</i>,
  <i>Oxyares</i>, <i>Axeres</i>, Prince <i>Axeres</i>, or <i>Cy-Axeres</i>,
  the word <i>Cy</i> signifying a Prince: for <i>Daniel</i> tells us, that
  <i>Darius</i> was the son of <i>Achsuerus</i>, or <i>Ahasuerus</i>, as
  the <i>Masoretes</i> erroneously call him, of the seed of the
  <i>Medes</i>, that is, of the seed royal: this is that <i>Assuerus</i>
  who together with <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> took and destroyed
  <i>Nineveh</i>, according to <i>Tobit</i>: which action is by the
  <i>Greeks</i> ascribed to <i>Cyaxeres</i>, and by <i>Eupolemus</i> to
  <i>Astibares</i>, a name perhaps corruptly written for <i>Assuerus</i>.
  By this victory over the <i>Assyrians</i>, and subversion of their Empire
  seated at <i>Nineveh</i>, and the ensuing conquests of <i>Armenia</i>,
  <i>Cappadocia</i> and <i>Persia</i>, he began to extend the Reign of one
  man over all <i>Asia</i>; and his son <i>Darius</i> the <i>Mede</i>, by
  conquering the Kingdoms of <i>Lydia</i> and <i>Babylon</i>, finished the
  work: and the third King was <i>Cyrus</i>, a happy man for his great
  successes under and against <i>Darius</i>, and large and peaceable
  dominion in his own Reign.</p>

  <p><i>Cyrus</i> lived seventy years, according to <i>Cicero</i>, and
  Reigned nine years over <i>Babylon</i>, according to <i>Ptolemy</i>'s
  Canon, and therefore was 61 years old at the taking of <i>Babylon</i>; at
  which time <i>Darius</i> the <i>Mede</i> was 62 years old, according to
  <i>Daniel</i>: and therefore <i>Darius</i> was two Generations younger
  than <i>Astyages</i>, the grandfather of <i>Cyrus</i>: for
  <i>Astyages</i>, according to both <a name="NtA_401"
  href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> <i>Herodotus</i> and <i>Xenophon</i>,
  gave his daughter <i>Mandane</i> to <i>Cambyses</i> a Prince of
  <i>Persia</i>, and by them became the grandfather of <i>Cyrus</i>; and
  <i>Cyaxeres</i> was the son of <i>Astyages</i>, according <a
  name="NtA_402" href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a> to <i>Xenophon</i>,
  and gave his Daughter to <i>Cyrus</i>. This daughter, <a name="NtA_403"
  href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> saith <i>Xenophon</i>, was reported
  to be very handsome, and used to play with <i>Cyrus</i> when they were
  both children, and to say that she would marry him: and therefore they
  were much of the same age. <i>Xenophon</i> saith that <i>Cyrus</i>
  married her after the taking of <i>Babylon</i>; but she was then an old
  woman: it's more probable that he married her while she was young and
  handsome, and he a young man; and that because he was the brother-in-law
  of <i>Darius</i> the King, he led the armies of the Kingdom until he
  revolted: so then <i>Astyages</i>, <i>Cyaxeres</i> and <i>Darius</i>
  Reigned successively over the <i>Medes</i>; and <i>Cyrus</i> was the
  grandson of <i>Astyages</i>, and married the sister of <i>Darius</i>, and
  succeeded him in the Throne.</p>

  <p><i>Herodotus</i> therefore <a name="NtA_404"
  href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> hath inverted the order of the Kings
  <i>Astyages</i> and <i>Cyaxeres</i>, making <i>Cyaxeres</i> to be the son
  and successor of <i>Phraortes</i>, and the father and predecessor of
  <i>Astyages</i> the father of <i>Mandane</i>, and grandfather of
  <i>Cyrus</i>, and telling us, that this <i>Astyages</i> married
  <i>Ariene</i> the daughter of <i>Alyattes</i> King of <i>Lydia</i>, and
  was at length taken prisoner and deprived of his dominion by
  <i>Cyrus</i>: and <i>Pausanias</i> hath copied after <i>Herodotus</i>, in
  telling us that <i>Astyages</i> the son of <i>Cyaxeres</i> Reigned in
  <i>Media</i> in the days of <i>Alyattes</i> King of <i>Lydia</i>.
  <i>Cyaxeres</i> had a son who married <i>Ariene</i> the daughter of
  <i>Alyattes</i>; but this son was not the father of <i>Mandane</i>, and
  grandfather of <i>Cyrus</i>, but of the same age with <i>Cyrus</i>: and
  his true name is preserved in the name of the <i>Darics</i>, which upon
  the conquest of <i>Cr&#339;sus</i> by the conduct of his General
  <i>Cyrus</i>, he coyned out of the gold and silver of the conquered
  <i>Lydians</i>: his name was therefore <i>Darius</i>, as he is called by
  <i>Daniel</i>; for <i>Daniel</i> tells us, that this <i>Darius</i> was a
  <i>Mede</i>, and that his father's name was <i>Assuerus</i>, that is
  <i>Axeres</i> or <i>Cyaxeres</i>, as above: considering therefore that
  <i>Cyaxeres</i> Reigned long, and that no author mentions more Kings of
  <i>Media</i> than one called <i>Astyages</i>, and that <i>Æschylus</i>
  who lived in those days knew but of two great Monarchs of <i>Media</i>
  and <i>Persia</i>, the father and the son, older than <i>Cyrus</i>; it
  seems to me that <i>Astyages</i>, the father of <i>Mandane</i> and
  grandfather of <i>Cyrus</i>, was the father and predecessor of
  <i>Cyaxeres</i>; and that the son and successor of <i>Cyaxeres</i> was
  called <i>Darius</i>. <i>Cyaxeres</i>, <a name="NtA_405"
  href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> according to <i>Herodotus</i>,
  Reigned 40 years, and his successor 35, and <i>Cyrus</i>, according to
  <i>Xenophon</i>, seven: <i>Cyrus</i> died <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 219,
  according to the Canon, and therefore <i>Cyaxeres</i> died <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 177, and began his Reign <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 137, and his
  father <i>Astyages</i> Reigned 26 years, beginning his Reign at the death
  of <i>Phraortes</i>, who was slain by the <i>Assyrians</i>, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 111, as above.</p>

  <p>Of all the Kings of the <i>Medes</i>, <i>Cyaxeres</i> was greatest
  warrior. <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_406"
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> saith that he was much more valiant
  than his ancestors, and that he was the first who divided the Kingdom
  into provinces, and reduced the irregular and undisciplined forces of the
  <i>Medes</i> into discipline and order: and therefore by the testimony of
  <i>Herodotus</i> he was that King of the <i>Medes</i> whom
  <i>Æschylus</i> makes the first conqueror and founder of the Empire; for
  <i>Herodotus</i> represents him and his son to have been the two
  immediate predecessors of <i>Cyrus</i>, erring only in the name of the
  son. <i>Astyages</i> did nothing glorious: in the beginning of his Reign
  a great body of <i>Scythians</i> commanded by <i>Madyes</i>, <a
  name="NtA_407" href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> invaded <i>Media</i>
  and <i>Parthia</i>, as above, and Reigned there about 28 years; but at
  length his son <i>Cyaxeres</i> circumvented and slew them in a feast, and
  made the rest fly to their brethren in <i>Parthia</i>; and immediately
  after, in conjunction with <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, invaded and subverted
  the Kingdom of <i>Assyria</i>, and destroyed <i>Nineveh</i>.</p>

  <p>In the fourth year of <i>Jehoiakim</i>, which the <i>Jews</i> reckon
  to be the first of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, dating his Reign from his being
  made King by his father, or from the month <i>Nisan</i> preceding, when
  the victors had newly shared the Empire of the <i>Assyrians</i>, and in
  prosecuting their victory were invading <i>Syria</i> and
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, and were ready to invade the nations round about;
  God <a name="NtA_408" href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a> threatned that
  <i>he would take all the families of the North, </i>that is, the armies
  of the <i>Medes</i>,<i> and </i>Nebuchadnezzar<i> the King of
  </i>Babylon<i>, and bring them against </i>Judæa<i> and against the
  nations round about, and utterly destroy those nations, and make them an
  astonishment and lasting desolations, and cause them all to drink the
  wine-cup of his fury</i>; and in particular, he names <i>the Kings of
  </i>Judah<i> and </i>Egypt<i>, and those of </i>Edom<i>, and </i>Moab<i>,
  and </i>Ammon<i>, and </i>Tyre<i>, and </i>Zidon<i>, and the Isles of the
  Sea, and </i>Arabia<i>, and </i>Zimri<i>, and all the Kings of
  </i>Elam<i>, and all the Kings of the </i>Medes<i>, and all the Kings of
  the North, and the King of </i>Sesac<i>; and that after seventy years, he
  would also punish the King of </i>Babylon. Here, in numbering the nations
  which should suffer, he omits the <i>Assyrians</i> as fallen already, and
  names the Kings of <i>Elam</i> or <i>Persia</i>, and <i>Sesac</i> or
  <i>Susa</i>, as distinct from those of the <i>Medes</i> and
  <i>Babylonians</i>; and therefore the <i>Persians</i> were not yet
  subdued by the <i>Medes</i>, nor the King of <i>Susa</i> by the
  <i>Chaldæans</i>; and as by the punishment of the King of <i>Babylon</i>
  he means the conquest of <i>Babylon</i> by the <i>Medes</i>; so by the
  punishment of the <i>Medes</i> he seems to mean the conquest of the
  <i>Medes</i> by <i>Cyrus</i>.</p>

  <p>After this, in the beginning of the Reign of <i>Zedekiah</i>, that is,
  in the ninth year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i> God threatned that <i>he
  would give the Kingdoms of </i>Edom<i>, </i>Moab<i>, and </i>Ammon<i>,
  and </i>Tyre<i> and </i>Zidon<i>, into the hand of </i>Nebuchadnezzar<i>
  King of </i>Babylon<i>, and that all the nations should serve him, and
  his son, and his son's son until the very time of his land should come,
  and many nations and great Kings should serve themselves of him</i>, Jer.
  xxvii. And at the same time God thus predicted the approaching conquest
  of the <i>Persians</i> by the <i>Medes</i> and their confederates:
  <i>Behold</i>, saith he, <i>I will break the bow of </i>Elam<i>, the
  chief of their might: and upon </i>Elam<i> will I bring the four winds
  from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them towards all those
  winds, and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of </i>Elam<i>
  shall not come: for I will cause </i>Elam<i> to be dismayed before their
  enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon
  them, even my fierce anger, saith the Lord; and I will send the sword
  after them 'till I have consumed them; and I will set my throne in
  </i>Elam<i>, and will destroy from thence the King and the Princes, saith
  the Lord: but it shall come to pass in the latter days, </i>viz. in the
  Reign of <i>Cyrus</i>,<i> that I will bring again the captivity of
  </i>Elam<i>, saith the Lord.</i> Jer. xlix. 35, <i>&amp;c.</i> The
  <i>Persians</i> were therefore hitherto a free nation under their own
  King, but soon after this were invaded, subdued, captivated, and
  dispersed into the nations round about, and continued in servitude until
  the Reign of <i>Cyrus</i>: and since the <i>Medes</i> and
  <i>Chaldæans</i> did not conquer the <i>Persians</i> 'till after the
  ninth year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, it gives us occasion to enquire what
  that active warrior <i>Cyaxeres</i> was doing next after the taking of
  <i>Nineveh</i>.</p>

  <p>When <i>Cyaxeres</i> expelled the <i>Scythians</i>, <a name="NtA_409"
  href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> some of them made their peace with
  him, and staid in <i>Media</i>, and presented to him daily some of the
  venison which they took in hunting: but happening one day to catch
  nothing, <i>Cyaxeres</i> in a passion treated them with opprobrious
  language: this they resented, and soon after killed one of the children
  of the <i>Medes</i>, dressed it like venison, and presented it to
  <i>Cyaxeres</i>, and then fled to <i>Alyattes</i> King of <i>Lydia</i>;
  whence followed a war of five years between the two Kings <i>Cyaxeres</i>
  and <i>Alyattes</i>: and thence I gather that the Kingdoms of the
  <i>Medes</i> and <i>Lydians</i> were now contiguous, and by consequence
  that <i>Cyaxeres</i>, soon after the conquest of <i>Nineveh</i>, seized
  the regions belonging to the <i>Assyrians</i>, as far as to the river
  <i>Halys</i>. In the sixth year of this war, in the midst of a battel
  between the two Kings, there was a total Eclipse of the Sun, predicted by
  <i>Thales</i>; <a name="NtA_410" href="#Nt_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> and
  this Eclipse fell upon the 28th of <i>May</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 163,
  forty and seven years before the taking of <i>Babylon</i>, and put an end
  to the battel: and thereupon the two Kings made peace by the mediation of
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> King of <i>Babylon</i>, and <i>Syennesis</i> King
  of <i>Cilicia</i>; and the peace was ratified by a marriage, between
  <i>Darius</i> the son of <i>Cyaxeres</i> and <i>Ariene</i> the daughter
  of <i>Alyattes</i>: <i>Darius</i> was therefore fifteen or sixteen years
  old at the time of this marriage; for he was 62 years old at the taking
  of <i>Babylon</i>.</p>

  <p>In the eleventh year of <i>Zedekiah's</i> Reign, the year in which
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> took <i>Jerusalem</i> and destroyed the Temple,
  <i>Ezekiel</i> comparing the Kingdoms of the East to trees in the garden
  of <i>Eden</i>, thus mentions their being conquered by the Kings of the
  <i>Medes</i> and <i>Chaldæans: Behold</i>, saith he, <i>the</i> Assyrian
  <i>was a Cedar in</i> Lebanon <i>with fair branches,&mdash;his height was
  exalted above all the trees of the field,&mdash;and under his shadow
  dwelt all great nations,&mdash;not any tree in the garden of God was like
  unto him in his beauty:&mdash;but I have delivered him into the hand of
  the mighty one of the heathen,&mdash;I made the nations to shake at the
  sound of his fall, when I cast him down to the grave with them that
  descend into the pit: and all the trees of </i>Eden<i>, the choice and
  best of </i>Lebanon<i>, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the
  nether parts of the earth: they also went down into the grave with him,
  unto them that be slain with the sword, and they that were his arm, that
  dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen,</i> Ezek. xxxi.</p>

  <p>The next year <i>Ezekiel</i>, in another prophesy, thus enumerates the
  principal nations who had been subdued and slaughtered by the conquering
  sword of <i>Cyaxeres</i> and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>. Asthur<i> is there
  and all her company, </i>viz. in <i>Hades</i> or the lower parts of the
  earth, where the dead bodies lay buried<i>, his graves are about him; all
  of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused their terrour in the
  land of the living. There is </i>Elam<i>, and all her multitude round
  about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone
  down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their
  terrour in the land of the living: yet have they born their shame with
  them that go down into the pit.&mdash;There is </i>Meshech<i>,
  </i>Tubal<i>, and all her multitude <a name="NtA_411"
  href="#Nt_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a>; her graves are round about him: all
  of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their
  terrour in the land of the living.&mdash;There is </i>Edom<i>, her Kings,
  and all her Princes, which with their might are laid by them that were
  slain by the sword.&mdash;There be the Princes of the North all of them,
  and all the </i>Zidonians<i>, which with their terrour are gone down with
  the slain</i>, Ezek. xxxii. Here by the Princes of the North I understand
  those on the north of <i>Judæa</i>, and chiefly the Princes of
  <i>Armenia</i> and <i>Cappadocia</i>, who fell in the wars which
  <i>Cyaxeres</i> made in reducing those countries after the taking of
  <i>Nineveh</i>. <i>Elam</i> or <i>Persia</i> was conquered by the
  <i>Medes</i>, and <i>Susiana</i> by the <i>Babylonians</i>, after the
  ninth, and before the nineteenth year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>: and
  therefore we cannot err much if we place these conquests in the twelfth
  or fourteenth year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>: in the nineteenth,
  twentieth, and one and twentieth year of this King, he invaded and <a
  name="NtA_412" href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a> conquered
  <i>Judæa</i>, <i>Moab</i>, <i>Ammon</i>, <i>Edom</i>, the
  <i>Philistims</i> and <i>Zidon</i>; and <a name="NtA_413"
  href="#Nt_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a> the next year he besieged
  <i>Tyre</i>, and after a siege of thirteen years he took it, in the 35th
  year of his Reign; and then he <a name="NtA_414"
  href="#Nt_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> invaded and conquered <i>Egypt</i>,
  <i>Ethiopia</i> and <i>Libya</i>; and about eighteen or twenty years
  after the death of this King, <i>Darius</i> the <i>Mede</i> conquered the
  Kingdom of <i>Sardes</i>; and after five or six years more he invaded and
  conquered the Empire of <i>Babylon</i>: and thereby finished the work of
  propagating the <i>Medo-Persian</i> Monarchy over all <i>Asia</i>, as
  <i>Æschylus</i> represents.</p>

  <p>Now this is that <i>Darius</i> who coined a great number of pieces of
  pure gold called <i>Darics</i>, or <i>Stateres Darici:</i> for
  <i>Suidas</i>, <i>Harpocration</i>, and the Scholiast of
  <i>Aristophanes</i>> <a name="NtA_415"
  href="#Nt_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a> tell us, that these were coined not
  by the father of <i>Xerxes</i>, but by an earlier <i>Darius</i>, by
  <i>Darius</i> the first, by the first King of the <i>Medes</i> and
  <i>Persians</i> who coined gold money. They were stamped on one side with
  the effigies of an Archer, who was crowned with a spiked crown, had a bow
  in his left hand, and an arrow in his right, and was cloathed with a long
  robe; I have seen one of them in gold, and another in silver: they were
  of the same weight and value with the <i>Attic Stater</i> or piece of
  gold money weighing two <i>Attic</i> drachms. <i>Darius</i> seems to have
  learnt the art and use of money from the conquered Kingdom of the
  <i>Lydians</i>, and to have recoined their gold: for the <i>Medes</i>,
  before they conquered the <i>Lydians</i>, had no money. <i>Herodotus</i>
  <a name="NtA_416" href="#Nt_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> tells us, that
  <i>when</i> Cr&#339;sus <i>was preparing to invade</i> Cyrus, <i>a
  certain </i>Lydian<i> called </i>Sandanis<i> advised him, that he was
  preparing an expedition against a nation who were cloathed with leathern
  breeches, who eat not such victuals as they would, but such as their
  barren country afforded; who drank no wine, but water only, who eat no
  figs nor other good meat, who had nothing to lose, but might get much
  from the </i>Lydians: <i>for the </i>Persians, saith <i>Herodotus</i>,
  <i>before they conquered the </i>Lydians<i>, had nothing rich or
  valuable</i>: and <a name="NtA_417" href="#Nt_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a>
  <i>Isaiah</i> tells us, that <i>the </i>Medes<i> regarded not silver, nor
  delighted in gold</i>; but the <i>Lydians</i> and <i>Phrygians</i> were
  exceeding rich, even to a proverb: <i>Midas &amp; Cr&#339;sus</i>, saith
  <a name="NtA_418" href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> <i>Pliny, infinitum
  possederant. Jam Cyrus devicta Asia</i> [auri] <i>pondo xxxiv millia
  invenerat, præter vasa aurea aurumque factum, &amp; in eo folia ac
  platanum vitemque. Qua victoria argenti quingenta millia talentorum
  reportavit, &amp; craterem Semiramidis cujus pondus quindecim talentorum
  colligebat. Talentum autem Ægyptium pondo octoginta capere Varro
  tradit.</i> What the conqueror did with all this gold and silver appears
  by the <i>Darics</i>. The <i>Lydians</i>, according to <a name="NtA_419"
  href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> <i>Herodotus</i>, were the first who
  coined gold and silver, and <i>Cr&#339;sus</i> coined gold monies in
  plenty, called <i>Cr&#339;sei</i>; and it was not reasonable that the
  monies of the Kings of <i>Lydia</i> should continue current after the
  overthrow of their Kingdom, and therefore <i>Darius</i> recoined it with
  his own effigies, but without altering the current weight and value: he
  Reigned then from before the conquest of <i>Sardes</i> 'till after the
  conquest of <i>Babylon</i>.</p>

  <p>And since the cup of <i>Semiramis</i> was preserved 'till the conquest
  of <i>Cr&#339;sus</i> by <i>Darius</i>, it is not probable that she could
  be older than is represented by <i>Herodotus</i>.</p>

  <p>This conquest of the Kingdom of <i>Lydia</i> put the <i>Greeks</i>
  into fear of the <i>Medes</i>: for <i>Theognis</i>, who lived at
  <i>Megara</i> in the very times of these wars, writes thus, <a

  <p>The Poet tells us further that discord had destroyed <i>Magnesia</i>,
  <i>Colophon</i>, and <i>Smyrna</i>, cities of <i>Ionia</i> and
  <i>Phrygia</i>, and would destroy the <i>Greeks</i>; which is as much as
  to say that the <i>Medes</i> had then conquered those cities.</p>

  <p>The <i>Medes</i> therefore Reigned 'till the taking of <i>Sardes</i>:
  and further, according to <i>Xenophon</i> and the Scriptures, they
  Reigned 'till the taking of <i>Babylon</i>: for <i>Xenophon</i> <a
  name="NtA_422" href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a> tells us, that after
  the taking of <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Cyrus</i> went to the King of the
  <i>Medes</i> at <i>Ecbatane</i> and succeeded him in the Kingdom: and
  <i>Jerom</i>, <a name="NtA_423" href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a>
  <i>that </i>Babylon<i> was taken by </i>Darius<i> King of the
  </i>Medes<i> and his kinsman </i>Cyrus: and the Scriptures tell us, that
  <i>Babylon</i> was destroyed by <i>a nation out of the north</i>,
  <i>Jerem</i>. l. 3, 9, 41. by <i>the Kingdoms of </i>Ararat Minni, or
  <i>Armenia, and </i>Ashchenez, or <i>Phrygia minor</i>, <i>Jer</i>. li.
  27. by the <i>Medes</i>, <i>Isa.</i> xiii. 17, 19. <i>by the Kings of the
  </i>Medes<i> and the captains and rulers thereof, and all the land of his
  dominion</i>, <i>Jer</i>. li. 11, 28. The Kingdom of <i>Babylon</i> was
  <i>numbred and finished and broken and given to the </i>Medes<i> and
  </i>Persians, <i>Dan.</i> v. 26. 28. first to the <i>Medes</i> under
  <i>Darius</i>, and then to the <i>Persians</i> under <i>Cyrus</i>: for
  <i>Darius</i> Reigned over <i>Babylon</i> like a conqueror, not observing
  the laws of the <i>Babylonians</i>, but introducing the immutable laws of
  the conquering nations, the <i>Medes</i> and <i>Persians</i>, <i>Dan.</i>
  vi. 8, 12, 15; and the <i>Medes</i> in his Reign are set before the
  <i>Persians</i>, <i>Dan.</i> ib. &amp; v. 28, &amp; viii. 20. as the
  <i>Persians</i> were afterwards in the Reign of <i>Cyrus</i> and his
  successors set before the <i>Medes</i>, <i>Esther</i> i. 3, 14, 18, 19.
  <i>Dan.</i> x. 1, 20. and xi. 2. which shews that in the Reign of
  <i>Darius</i> the <i>Medes</i> were uppermost.</p>

  <p>You may know also by the great number of provinces in the Kingdom of
  <i>Darius</i>, that he was King of the <i>Medes</i> and <i>Persians</i>:
  for upon the conquest of <i>Babylon</i>, he set over the whole Kingdom an
  hundred and twenty Princes, <i>Dan.</i> vi. 1. and afterwards when
  <i>Cambyses</i> and <i>Darius Hystaspis</i> had added some new
  territories, the whole contained but 127 provinces.</p>

  <p>The extent of the <i>Babylonian</i> Empire was much the same with that
  of <i>Nineveh</i> after the revolt of the <i>Medes</i>. <i>Berosus</i>
  saith that <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> held <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Syria</i>,
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and <i>Arabia</i>: and <i>Strabo</i> adds
  <i>Arbela</i> to the territories of <i>Babylon</i>; and saying that
  <i>Babylon</i> was anciently the metropolis of <i>Assyria</i>, he thus
  describes the limits of this <i>Assyrian</i> Empire. <i>Contiguous</i>,
  <a name="NtA_424" href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> saith he, <i>to
  </i>Persia<i> and </i>Susiana<i> are the </i>Assyrians<i>: for so they
  call </i>Babylonia<i>, and the greatest part of the region about it: part
  of which is </i>Arturia<i>, wherein is </i>Ninus [<i>or</i> Nineveh;]<i>
  and </i>Apolloniatis<i>, and the </i>Elymæans<i>, and the
  </i>Parætacæ<i>, and </i>Chalonitis<i> by the mountain </i>Zagrus<i>, and
  the fields near </i>Ninus<i>, and </i>Dolomene<i>, and </i>Chalachene<i>,
  and </i>Chazene<i>, and </i>Adiabene<i>, and the nations of
  </i>Mesopotamia<i> near the </i>Gordyæans<i>, and the </i>Mygdones<i>
  about </i>Nisibis<i>, unto </i>Zeugma<i> upon </i>Euphrates<i>; and a
  large region on this side </i>Euphrates<i> inhabited by the
  </i>Arabians<i> and </i>Syrians<i> properly so called, as far as
  </i>Cilicia<i> and </i>Ph&#339;nicia<i> and </i>Libya<i> and the sea of
  </i>Egypt<i> and the </i>Sinus Issicus: and a little after describing the
  extent of the <i>Babylonian</i> region, he bounds it on the north, with
  the <i>Armenians</i> and <i>Medes</i> unto the mountain <i>Zagrus</i>; on
  the east side, with <i>Susa</i> and <i>Elymais</i> and <i>Parætacene</i>,
  inclusively; on the south, with the <i>Persian Gulph</i> and
  <i>Chaldæa</i>; and on the west, with the <i>Arabes Scenitæ</i> as far as
  <i>Adiabene</i> and <i>Gordyæa</i>: afterwards speaking of <i>Susiana</i>
  and <i>Sitacene</i>, a region between <i>Babylon</i> and <i>Susa</i>, and
  of <i>Parætacene</i> and <i>Cossæa</i> and <i>Elymais</i>, and of the
  <i>Sagapeni</i> and <i>Siloceni</i>, two little adjoining Provinces, he
  concludes, <a name="NtA_425" href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a> <i>and
  these are the nations which inhabit </i>Babylonia<i> eastward: to the
  north are </i>Media<i> and </i>Armenia<i>, </i>exclusively<i>, and
  westward are </i>Adiabene<i> and </i>Mesopotamia<i>, </i>inclusively<i>;
  the greatest part of </i>Adiabene<i> is plain, the same being part of
  </i>Babylonia<i>: in same places it borders on </i>Armenia<i>: for the
  </i>Medes<i>, </i>Armenians<i> and </i>Babylonians<i> warred frequently
  on one another</i>. Thus far <i>Strabo</i>.</p>

  <p>When <i>Cyrus</i> took <i>Babylon</i>, he changed the Kingdom into a
  Satrapy or Province: whereby the bounds were long after known: and by
  this means <i>Herodotus</i> <a name="NtA_426"
  href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> gives us an estimate of the bigness
  of this Monarchy in proportion to that of the <i>Persians</i>, telling us
  that <i>whilst every region over which the King of </i>Persia<i> Reigned
  in his days, was distributed for the nourishment of his army, besides the
  tributes, the </i>Babylonian<i> region nourished him four months of the
  twelve in the year, and all the rest of </i>Asia<i> eight: so the power
  of the region</i>, saith he, <i>is equivalent to the third part of
  </i>Asia<i>, and its Principality, which the </i>Persians<i> call a
  </i>Satrapy<i>, is far the best of all the Provinces</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Babylon</i> <a name="NtA_427" href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a>
  was a square city of 120 furlongs, or 15 miles on every side, compassed
  first with a broad and deep ditch, and then with a wall fifty cubits
  thick, and two hundred high. <i>Euphrates</i> flowed through the middle
  of it southward, a few leagues on this side <i>Tigris</i>: and in the
  middle of one half westward stood the King's new Palace, built by
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>; and in the middle of the other half stood the
  Temple of <i>Belus</i>, with the old Palace between that Temple and the
  river: this old Palace was built by the <i>Assyrians</i>, according to <a
  name="NtA_428" href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> <i>Isaiah</i>, and by
  consequence, by <i>Pul</i> and his son <i>Nabonassar</i>, as above:
  <i>they founded the city for the </i>Arabians<i>, and set up the towers
  thereof, and raised the Palaces thereof</i>: and at that time
  <i>Sabacon</i> the <i>Ethiopian</i> invaded <i>Egypt</i>, and made great
  multitudes of <i>Egyptians</i> fly from him into <i>Chaldæa</i>, and
  carry thither their Astronomy, and Astrology, and Architecture, and the
  form of their year, which they preserved there in the <i>Æra</i> of
  <i>Nabonassar</i>: for the practice of observing the Stars began in
  <i>Egypt</i> in the days of <i>Ammon</i>, as above, and was propagated
  from thence in the Reign of his son <i>Sesac</i> into <i>Afric</i>,
  <i>Europe</i>, and <i>Asia</i> by conquest; and then <i>Atlas</i> formed
  the Sphere of the <i>Libyans</i>, and <i>Chiron</i> that of the
  <i>Greeks</i>, and the <i>Chaldæans</i> also made a Sphere of their own.
  But Astrology was invented in <i>Egypt</i> by <i>Nichepsos</i>, or
  <i>Necepsos</i>, one of the Kings of the lower <i>Egypt</i>, and
  <i>Petosiris</i> his Priest, a little before the days of <i>Sabacon</i>,
  and propagated thence into <i>Chaldæa</i>, where <i>Zoroaster</i> the
  Legislator of the <i>Magi</i> met with it: so <i>Paulinus</i>,</p>

  <p>And <i>Diodorus</i>, <a name="NtA_429"
  href="#Nt_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a> <i>they say that the </i>Chaldæans<i>
  in </i>Babylonia<i> are colonies of the </i>Egyptians<i>, and being
  taught by the Priests of </i>Egypt<i> became famous for Astrology</i>. By
  the influence of the same colonies, the Temple of <i>Jupiter Belus</i> in
  <i>Babylon</i> seems to have been erected in the form of the
  <i>Egyptian</i> Pyramids: for <a name="NtA_430"
  href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a> this Temple was a solid Tower or
  Pyramid a furlong square, and a furlong high, with seven retractions,
  which made it appear like eight towers standing upon one another, and
  growing less and less to the top: and in the eighth tower was a Temple
  with a bed and a golden table, kept by a woman, after the manner of the
  <i>Egyptians</i> in the Temple of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> at <i>Thebes</i>;
  and above the Temple was a place for observing the Stars: they went up to
  the top of it by steps on the outside, and the bottom was compassed with
  a court, and the court with a building two furlongs in length on every
  side.</p>

  <p>The <i>Babylonians</i> were extreamly addicted to Sorcery,
  Inchantments, Astrology and Divinations, <i>Isa.</i> xlvii. 9, 12, 13.
  <i>Dan.</i> ii. 2, &amp; v. 11. and to the worship of Idols, <i>Jer.</i>
  l. 2, 40. and to feasting, wine and women. <i>Nihil urbis ejus corruptius
  moribus, nec ad irritandas illiciendasque immodicas voluptates
  instructius. Liberos conjugesque cum hospitibus stupro coire, modo
  pretium flagitii detur, parentes maritique patiuntur. Convivales ludi
  tota Perside regibus purpuratisque cordi sunt: Babylonii maxime in vinum
  &amp; quæ ebrietatem sequuntur effusi sunt. Fæminarum convivia ineuntium
  in principio modestus est habitus; dein summa quæque amicula exuunt,
  paulatimque pudorem profanant: ad ultimum, honos auribus sit, ima
  corporum velamenta projiciunt. Nec meretricum hoc dedecus est, sed
  matronarum virginumque, apud quas comitas habetur vulgati corporis
  vilitas.</i> <i>Q. Curtius</i>, lib. v. cap. 1. And this lewdness of
  their women, coloured over with the name of civility, was encouraged even
  by their religion: for it was the custom for their women once in their
  life to sit in the Temple of <i>Venus</i> for the use of strangers; which
  Temple they called <i>Succoth Benoth</i>, the Temple of Women: and when
  any woman was once sat there, she was not to depart 'till some stranger
  threw money into her bosom, took her away and lay with her; and the money
  being for sacred uses, she was obliged to accept of it how little soever,
  and follow the stranger.</p>

  <p>The <i>Persians</i> being conquered by the <i>Medes</i> about the
  middle of the Reign of <i>Zedekiah</i>, continued in subjection under
  them 'till the end of the Reign of <i>Darius</i> the <i>Mede</i>: and
  <i>Cyrus</i>, who was of the Royal Family of the <i>Persians</i>, might
  be <i>Satrapa</i> of <i>Persia</i>, and command a body of their forces
  under <i>Darius</i>; but was not yet an absolute and independant King:
  but after the taking of <i>Babylon</i>, when he had a victorious army at
  his devotion, and <i>Darius</i> was returned from <i>Babylon</i> into
  <i>Media</i>, he revolted from <i>Darius</i>, in conjunction with the
  <i>Persians</i> under him; <a name="NtA_431"
  href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a> they being incited thereunto by
  <i>Harpagus</i> a <i>Mede</i>, whom <i>Xenophon</i> calls
  <i>Artagerses</i> and <i>Atabazus</i>, and who had assisted <i>Cyrus</i>
  in conquering <i>Cr&#339;sus</i> and <i>Asia minor</i>, and had been
  injured by <i>Darius</i>. <i>Harpagus</i> was sent by <i>Darius</i> with
  an army against <i>Cyrus</i>, and in the midst of a battel revolted with
  part of the army to <i>Cyrus</i>: <i>Darius</i> got up a fresh army, and
  the next year the two armies fought again: this last battel was fought at
  <i>Pasargadæ</i> in <i>Persia</i>, according to <a name="NtA_432"
  href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a> <i>Strabo</i>; and there
  <i>Darius</i> was beaten and taken Prisoner by <i>Cyrus</i>, and the
  Monarchy was by this victory translated to the <i>Persians</i>. The last
  King of the <i>Medes</i> is by <i>Xenophon</i> called <i>Cyaxares</i>,
  and by <i>Herodotus</i>, <i>Astyages</i> the father of <i>Mandane</i>:
  but these Kings were dead before, and <i>Daniel</i> lets us know that
  <i>Darius</i> was the true name of the last King, and <i>Herodotus</i>,
  <a name="NtA_433" href="#Nt_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a> that the last King
  was conquered by <i>Cyrus</i> in the manner above described; and the
  <i>Darics</i> coined by the last King testify that his name was
  <i>Darius</i>.</p>

  <p>This victory over <i>Darius</i> was about two years after the taking
  of <i>Babylon</i>: for the Reign or <i>Nabonnedus</i> the last King of
  the <i>Chaldees</i>, whom <i>Josephus</i> calls <i>Naboandel</i> and
  <i>Belshazzar</i>, ended in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 210, nine years
  before the death of <i>Cyrus</i>, according to the Canon: but after the
  translation of the Kingdom of the <i>Medes</i> to the <i>Persians</i>,
  <i>Cyrus</i> Reigned only seven years, according to <a name="NtA_434"
  href="#Nt_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a> <i>Xenophon</i>; and spending the
  seven winter months yearly at <i>Babylon</i>, the three spring months
  yearly at <i>Susa</i>, and the two Summer months at <i>Ecbatane</i>, he
  came the seventh time into <i>Persia</i>, and died there in the spring,
  and was buried at <i>Pasargadae</i>. By the Canon and the common consent
  of all Chronologers, he died in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 219, and
  therefore conquered <i>Darius</i> in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 212,
  seventy and two years after the destruction of <i>Nineveh</i>, and beat
  him the first time in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 211, and revolted
  from him, and became King of the <i>Persians</i>, either the same year,
  or in the end of the year before. At his death he was seventy years old
  according to <i>Herodotus</i>, and therefore he was born in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 149, his mother <i>Mandane</i> being the sister of
  <i>Cyaxeres</i>, at that time a young man, and also the sister of
  <i>Amyite</i> the wife of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, and his father
  <i>Cambyses</i> being of the old Royal Family of the <i>Persians</i>.</p>

<h3><i>A Description of the </i>T<font class="sc">EMPLE</font><i> of </i>Solomon<i>.</i></h3>

  <p><a name="NtA_435" href="#Nt_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> The Temple of
  <i>Solomon</i> being destroyed by the <i>Babylonians</i>, it may not be
  amiss here to give a description of that edifice.</p>

  <p>This <a name="NtA_436" href="#Nt_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a> Temple
  looked eastward, and stood in a square area, called the <i>Separate
  Place</i>: and <a name="NtA_437" href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a>
  before it stood the <i>Altar</i>, in the center of another square area,
  called the <i>Inner Court</i>, or <i>Court of the Priests</i>: and these
  two square areas, being parted only by a marble rail, made an area 200
  cubits long from west to east, and 100 cubits broad: this area was
  compassed on the west with a wall, and <a name="NtA_438"
  href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a> on the other three sides with a
  pavement fifty cubits broad, upon which stood the buildings for the
  Priests, with cloysters under them: and the pavement was faced on the
  inside with a marble rail before the cloysters: the whole made an area
  250 cubits long from west to east, and 200 broad, and was compassed with
  an outward Court, called also the <i>Great Court</i>, or <i>Court of the
  People</i>, <a name="NtA_439" href="#Nt_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a> which
  was an hundred cubits on every side; for there were but two Courts built
  by <i>Solomon</i>: and the outward Court was about four cubits lower than
  the inward, and was compassed on the west with a wall, and on the other
  three sides <a name="NtA_440" href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a> with a
  pavement fifty cubits broad, upon which stood the buildings for the
  People. All this was the <a name="NtA_441"
  href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a> <i>Sanctuary</i>, and made a square
  area 500 cubits long, and 500 broad, and was compassed with a walk,
  called the <i>Mountain of the House</i>: and this walk being 50 cubits
  broad, was compassed with a wall six cubits broad, and six high, and six
  hundred long on every side: and the cubit was about 21½, or almost 22
  inches of the <i>English</i> foot, being the sacred cubit of the
  <i>Jews</i>, which was an hand-breadth, or the sixth part of its length
  bigger than the common cubit.</p>

  <p>The <i>Altar</i> stood in the center of the whole; and in the
  buildings of <a name="NtA_442" href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a> both
  Courts over against the middle of the <i>Altar</i>, eastward, southward,
  and northward, were gates <a name="NtA_443"
  href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a> 25 cubits broad between the
  buildings, and 40 long; with porches of ten cubits more, looking towards
  the <i>Altar Court</i>, which made the whole length of the gates fifty
  cubits cross the pavements. Every gate had two doors, one at either <a
  name="NtA_444" href="#Nt_444"><sup>[444]</sup></a> end, ten cubits wide,
  and twenty high, with posts and thresholds six cubits broad: within the
  gates was an area 28 cubits long between the thresholds, and 13 cubits
  wide: and on either side of this area were three posts, each six cubits
  square, and twenty high, with arches five cubits wide between them: all
  which posts and arches filled the 28 cubits in length between the
  thresholds; and their breadth being added to the thirteen cubits, made
  the whole breadth of the gates 25 cubits. These posts were hollow, and
  had rooms in them with narrow windows for the porters, and a step before
  them a cubit broad: and the walls of the porches being six cubits thick,
  were also hollow for several uses. <a name="NtA_445"
  href="#Nt_445"><sup>[445]</sup></a> At the east gate of the <i>Peoples
  Court</i>, called the <i>King's gate</i>, <a name="NtA_446"
  href="#Nt_446"><sup>[446]</sup></a> were six porters, at the south gate
  were four, and at the north gate were four: the people <a name="NtA_447"
  href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a> went in and out at the south and
  north gates: the <a name="NtA_448" href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a>
  east gate was opened only for the King, and in this gate he ate the
  Sacrifices. There were also four gates or doors in the western wall of
  the <i>Mountain of the House</i>: of these <a name="NtA_449"
  href="#Nt_449"><sup>[449]</sup></a> the most northern, called
  <i>Shallecheth</i>, or the <i>gate of the causey</i>, led to the King's
  palace, the valley between being filled up with a causey: the next gate,
  called <i>Parbar</i>, led to the suburbs <i>Millo</i>: the third and
  fourth gates, called <i>Asuppim</i>, led the one to <i>Millo</i>, the
  other to the city of <i>Jerusalem</i>, there being steps down into the
  valley and up again into the city. At the gate <i>Shallecheth</i> were
  four porters; at the other three gates were six porters, two at each
  gate: the house of the porters who had the charge of the north gate of
  the <i>People's Court</i>, had also the charge of the gates
  <i>Shallecheth</i> and <i>Parbar</i>: and the house of the porters who
  had the charge of the south gate of the <i>People s Court</i>, had also
  the charge of the other two gates called <i>Asuppim</i>.</p>

  <p>They came through the four western gates into the <i>Mountain of the
  House</i>, and <a name="NtA_450" href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> went
  up from the <i>Mountain of the House</i>, to the gates of the <i>People's
  Court</i> by seven steps, and from the <i>People's Court</i> to the gates
  of the <i>Priest's Court</i> by eight steps: <a name="NtA_451"
  href="#Nt_451"><sup>[451]</sup></a> and the arches in the sides of the
  gates of both courts led into cloysters <a name="NtA_452"
  href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a> under a double building, supported by
  three rows of marble pillars, which butted directly upon the middles of
  the square posts, ran along from thence upon the pavements towards the
  corners of the Courts: the axes of the pillars in the middle row being
  eleven cubits distant from the axes of the pillars in the other two rows
  on either hand; and the building joining to the sides of the gates: the
  pillars were three cubits in diameter below, and their bases four cubits
  and an half square. The gates and buildings of both Courts were alike,
  and <a name="NtA_453" href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a> faced their
  Courts: the cloysters of all the buildings, and the porches of all the
  gates looking towards the <i>Altar</i>. The row of pillars on the
  backsides of the cloysters adhered to marble walls, which bounded the
  cloysters and supported the buildings: <a name="NtA_454"
  href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a> these buildings were three stories
  high above the cloysters, and <a name="NtA_455"
  href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> were supported in each of those
  stories by a row of cedar beams, or pillars of cedar, standing above the
  middle row of the marble pillars: the buildings on either side of every
  gate of the <i>People's Court</i>, being 187½ cubits long, were
  distinguished into five chambers on a floor, running in length from the
  gates to the corners or the Courts: there <a name="NtA_456"
  href="#Nt_456"><sup>[456]</sup></a> being in all thirty chambers in a
  story, where the People ate the Sacrifices, or thirty exhedras, each of
  which contained three chambers, a lower, a middle, and an upper: every
  exhedra was 37½ cubits long, being supported by four pillars in each row,
  <a name="NtA_457" href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a> whose bases were 4½
  cubits square, and the distances between their bases 6½ cubits, and the
  distances between the axes of the pillars eleven cubits: and where two <a
  name="NtA_458" href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> exhedras joyned, there
  the bases of their pillars joyned; the axes of those two pillars being
  only 4½ cubits distant from one another: and perhaps for strengthning the
  building, the space between the axes of these two pillars in the front
  was filled up with a marble column 4½ cubits square, the two pillars
  standing half out on either side of the square column. At the ends of
  these buildings <a name="NtA_459" href="#Nt_459"><sup>[459]</sup></a> in
  the four corners of the <i>Peoples Court</i>, were little Courts fifty
  cubits square on the outside of their walls, and forty on the inside
  thereof, for stair-cases to the buildings, and kitchins to bake and boil
  the Sacrifices for the People, the kitchin being thirty cubits broad, and
  the stair-case ten. The buildings on either side of the gates of the
  <i>Priests Court</i> were also 37½ cubits long, and contained each of
  them one great chamber in a story, subdivided into smaller rooms, for the
  Great Officers of the Temple, and Princes of the Priests: and in the
  south-east and north-east corners of this court, at the ends of the
  buildings, were kitchins and stair-cases for the Great Officers; and
  perhaps rooms for laying up wood for the <i>Altar</i>.</p>

  <p>In the eastern gate of the <i>Peoples Court</i>, sat a Court of
  Judicature, composed of 23 Elders. The eastern gate of the <i>Priests
  Court</i>, with the buildings on either side, was for the High-Priest,
  and his deputy the <i>Sagan</i>, and for the <i>Sanhedrim</i> or Supreme
  Court of Judicature, composed of seventy Elders. <a name="NtA_460"
  href="#Nt_460"><sup>[460]</sup></a> The building or exhedra on the
  eastern side of the southern gate, was for the Priests who had the
  oversight of the charge of the <i>Sanctuary</i> with its treasuries: and
  these were, first, two <i>Catholikim</i>, who were High-Treasurers and
  Secretaries to the High-Priest, and examined, stated, and prepared all
  acts and accounts to be signed and sealed by him; then seven
  <i>Amarcholim</i>, who kept the keys of the seven locks of every gate of
  the <i>Sanctuary</i>, and those also of the treasuries, and had the
  oversight, direction, and appointment of all things in the
  <i>Sanctuary</i>; then three or more <i>Gisbarim</i>, or
  Under-Treasurers, or Receivers, who kept the Holy Vessels, and the
  Publick Money, and received or disposed of such sums as were brought in
  for the service of the Temple, and accounted for the same. All these,
  with the High-Priest, composed the Supreme Council for managing the
  affairs of the Temple.</p>

  <p>The Sacrifices <a name="NtA_461" href="#Nt_461"><sup>[461]</sup></a>
  were killed on the northern side of the <i>Altar</i>, and flea'd, cut in
  pieces and salted in the northern gate of the Temple; and therefore the
  building or exhedra on the eastern side of this gate, was for the Priests
  who had the oversight of the charge of the <i>Altar</i>, and Daily
  Service: and these Officers were, He that received money of the People
  for purchasing things for the Sacrifices, and gave out tickets for the
  same; He that upon sight of the tickets delivered the wine, flower and
  oyl purchased; He that was over the lots, whereby every Priest attending
  on the <i>Altar</i> had his duty assigned; He that upon sight of the
  tickets delivered out the doves and pigeons purchased; He that
  administred physic to the Priests attending; He that was over the waters;
  He that was over the times, and did the duty of a cryer, calling the
  Priests or Levites to attend in their ministeries; He that opened the
  gates in the morning to begin the service, and shut them in the evening
  when the service was done, and for that end received the keys of the
  <i>Amarcholim</i>, and returned them when he had done his duty; He that
  visited the night-watches; He that by a Cymbal called the Levites to
  their stations for singing; He that appointed the Hymns and set the Tune;
  and He that took care of the Shew-Bread: there were also Officers who
  took care of the Perfume, the Veil, and the Wardrobe of the Priests.</p>

  <p>The exhedra on the western side of the south gate, and that on the
  western side of the north gate, were for the Princes of the four and
  twenty courses of the Priests, one exhedra for twelve of the Princes, <a
  name="NtA_462" href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a> and the other exhedra
  for the other twelve: and upon the pavement on either side of the
  <i>Separate Place</i> <a name="NtA_463"
  href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> were other buildings without
  cloysters, for the four and twenty courses of the Priests to eat the
  Sacrifices, and lay up their garments and the most holy things: each
  pavement being 100 cubits long, and 50 broad, had buildings on either
  side of it twenty cubits broad, with a walk or alley ten cubits broad
  between them: the building which bordered upon the <i>Separate Place</i>
  was an hundred cubits long, and that next the <i>Peoples Court</i> but
  fifty, the other fifty cubits westward <a name="NtA_464"
  href="#Nt_464"><sup>[464]</sup></a> being for a stair-case and kitchin:
  these buildings <a name="NtA_465" href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a>
  were three stories high, and the middle story was narrower in the front
  than the lower story, and the upper story still narrower, to make room
  for galleries; for they had galleries before them, and under the
  galleries were closets for laying up the holy things, and the garments of
  the Priests, and these galleries were towards the walk or alley, which
  ran between the buildings.</p>

  <p>They went up from the <i>Priests Court</i> to the Porch of the Temple
  by ten steps: and the <a name="NtA_466"
  href="#Nt_466"><sup>[466]</sup></a> House of the Temple was twenty cubits
  broad, and sixty long within; or thirty broad, and seventy long,
  including the walls; or seventy cubits broad, and 90 long, including a
  building of treasure-chambers which was twenty cubits broad on three
  sides of the House; and if the Porch be also included, the Temple was <a
  name="NtA_467" href="#Nt_467"><sup>[467]</sup></a> an hundred cubits
  long. The treasure-chambers were built of cedar, between the wall of the
  Temple, and another wall without: they were <a name="NtA_468"
  href="#Nt_468"><sup>[468]</sup></a> built in two rows three stories high,
  and opened door against door into a walk or gallery which ran along
  between them, and was five cubits broad in every story; So that the
  breadth of the chambers on either side of the gallery, including the
  breadth of the wall to which they adjoined, was ten cubits; and the whole
  breadth of the gallery and chambers, and both walls, was five and twenty
  cubits: the chambers <a name="NtA_469"
  href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a> were five cubits broad in the lower
  story, six broad in the middle story, and seven broad in the upper story;
  for the wall of the Temple was built with retractions of a cubit, to rest
  the timber upon. <i>Ezekiel</i> represents the chambers a cubit narrower,
  and the walls a cubit thicker than they were in <i>Solomon</i>'s Temple:
  there were <a name="NtA_470" href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> thirty
  chambers in a story, in all ninety chambers, and they were five cubits
  high in every story. The <a name="NtA_471"
  href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a> Porch of the Temple was 120 cubits
  high, and its length from south to north equalled the breadth of the
  House: the House was three stories high, which made the height of the
  <i>Holy Place</i> three times thirty cubits, and that of the <i>Most
  Holy</i> three times twenty: the upper rooms were treasure-chambers; they
  <a name="NtA_472" href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a> went up to the
  middle chamber by winding stairs in the southern shoulder of the House,
  and from the middle into the upper.</p>

  <p>Some time after this Temple was built, the <i>Jews</i> <a
  name="NtA_473" href="#Nt_473"><sup>[473]</sup></a> added a <i>New
  Court</i>, on the eastern side of the <i>Priests Court</i>, before the
  <i>King's gate</i>, and therein built <a name="NtA_474"
  href="#Nt_474"><sup>[474]</sup></a> a covert for the Sabbath: this Court
  was not measured by <i>Ezekiel</i>, but the dimensions thereof may be
  gathered from those of the <i>Womens Court</i>, in the second Temple,
  built after the example thereof: for when <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> had
  destroyed the first Temple, <i>Zerubbabel</i>, by the commissions of
  <i>Cyrus</i> and <i>Darius</i>, built another upon the same area,
  excepting the <i>Outward Court</i>, which was left open to the
  <i>Gentiles</i>: and this Temple <a name="NtA_475"
  href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a> was sixty cubits long, and sixty
  broad, being only two stories in height, and having only one row of
  treasure-chambers about it: and on either side of the <i>Priests
  Court</i> were double buildings for the Priests, built upon three rows of
  marble pillars in the lower story, with a row of cedar beams or pillars
  in the stories above: and the cloyster in the lower story looked towards
  the <i>Priests Court</i>: and the <i>Separate Place</i>, and <i>Priests
  Court</i>, with their buildings on the north and south sides, and the
  <i>Womens Court</i>, at the east end, took up an area three hundred
  cubits long, and two hundred broad, the <i>Altar</i> standing in the
  center of the whole. The <i>Womens Court</i> was so named, because the
  women came into it as well as the men: there were galleries for the
  women, and the men worshipped upon the ground below: and in this state
  the second Temple continued all the Reign of the <i>Persians</i>; but
  afterwards suffered some alterations, especially in the days of
  <i>Herod</i>.</p>

  <p>This description of the Temple being taken principally from
  <i>Ezekiel</i>'s Vision thereof; and the ancient <i>Hebrew</i> copy
  followed by the Seventy, differing in some readings from the copy
  followed by the editors of the present <i>Hebrew</i>, I will here subjoin
  that part of the Vision which relates to the <i>Outward Court</i>, as I
  have deduced it from the present <i>Hebrew</i>, and the version of the
  Seventy compared together.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VI.</h2>

<h3><i>Of the Empire of the </i>Persians<i>.</i></h3>

  <p><i>Cyrus</i> having translated the Monarchy to the <i>Persians</i>,
  and Reigned seven years, was succeeded by his son <i>Cambyses</i>, who
  Reigned seven years and five months, and in the three last years of his
  Reign subdued <i>Egypt</i>: he was succeeded by <i>Mardus</i>, or
  <i>Smerdis</i> the <i>Magus</i>, who feigned himself to be <i>Smerdis</i>
  the brother of <i>Cambyses</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Smerdis</i> Reigned seven months, and in the eighth month being
  discovered, was slain, with a great number of the <i>Magi</i>; so the
  <i>Persians</i> called their Priests, and in memory of this kept an
  anniversary day, which they called, <i>The slaughter of the </i>Magi.
  Then Reigned <i>Maraphus</i> and <i>Artaphernes</i> a few days, and after
  them <i>Darius</i> the son of <i>Hystaspes</i>, the son of
  <i>Arsamenes</i>, of the family of <i>Achæmenes</i>, a <i>Persian</i>,
  being chosen King by the neighing of his horse: before he Reigned his <a
  name="NtA_479" href="#Nt_479"><sup>[479]</sup></a> name was <i>Ochus</i>.
  He seems on this occasion to have reformed the constitution of the
  <i>Magi</i>, making his father <i>Hystaspes</i> their Master, or
  <i>Archimagus</i>; for <i>Porphyrius</i> tells us, <a name="NtA_480"
  href="#Nt_480"><sup>[480]</sup></a> that <i>the </i>Magi<i> were a sort
  of men so venerable amongst the </i>Persians<i>, that </i>Darius<i> the
  son of </i>Hystaspes<i> wrote on the monument of his father</i>, amongst
  other things, <i>that he had been the Master of the </i>Magi. In this
  reformation of the <i>Magi</i>, <i>Hystaspes</i> was assisted by
  <i>Zoroastres</i>: so <i>Agathias</i>; <i>The </i>Persians<i> at this day
  say simply that </i>Zoroastres<i> lived under </i>Hystaspes: and
  <i>Apuleius</i>; <i>Pythagoram, aiunt, inter captivos Cambysæ Regis
  </i>[ex Ægypto Babylonem abductos]<i> doctores habuisse Persarum Magos,
  &amp; præcipue Zoroastrem, omnis divini arcani Antistitem</i>. By
  <i>Zoroastres</i>'s conversing at <i>Babylon</i> he seems to have
  borrowed his skill from the <i>Chaldæans</i>; for he was skilled in
  Astronomy, and used their year: so <i>Q. Curtius</i>; <a name="NtA_481"
  href="#Nt_481"><sup>[481]</sup></a> <i>Magi proximi patrium carmen
  canebant: Magos trecenti &amp; sexaginta quinque juvenes sequebantur,
  puniceis amiculis velati, diebus totius anni pares numero</i>: and
  <i>Ammianus</i>; <i>Scientiæ multa ex Chaldæorum arcanis Bactrianus
  addidit Zoroastres</i>. From his conversing in several places he is
  reckoned a <i>Chaldæan</i>, an <i>Assyrian</i>, a <i>Mede</i>, a
  <i>Persian</i>, a <i>Bactrian</i>. <i>Suidas</i> calls him <a
  name="NtA_482" href="#Nt_482"><sup>[482]</sup></a> a <i>Perso-Mede</i>,
  and saith that he was <i>the most skilful of Astronomers, and first
  author of the name of the </i>Magi<i> received among them</i>. This skill
  in Astronomy he had doubtless from the <i>Chaldæans</i>, but
  <i>Hystaspes</i> travelled into <i>India</i>, to be instructed by the
  <i>Gymnosophists</i>: and these two conjoyning their skill and authority,
  instituted a new set of Priests or <i>Magi</i>, and instructed them in
  such ceremonies and mysteries of Religion and Philosophy as they thought
  fit to establish for the Religion and Philosophy of that Empire; and
  these instructed others, 'till from a small number they grew to a great
  multitude: for <i>Suidas</i> tells us, that <i>Zoroastres gave a
  beginning to the name of the </i>Magi: and <i>Elmacinus</i>; that <i>he
  reformed the religion of the </i>Persians<i>, which before was divided
  into many sects</i>: and <i>Agathias</i>; that <i>he introduced the
  religion of the </i>Magi<i> among the </i>Persians<i>, changing their
  ancient sacred rites, and bringing in several opinions</i>: and
  <i>Ammianus</i> <a name="NtA_483" href="#Nt_483"><sup>[483]</sup></a>
  tells us, <i>Magiam esse divinorum incorruptissimum cultum, cujus
  scientiæ seculis priscis multa ex Chaldæorum arcanis Bactrianus addidit
  Zoroastres: deinde Hystaspes Rex prudentissimus Darii pater; qui quum
  superioris Indiæ secreta fidentius penetraret, ad nemorosam quamdam
  venerat solitudinem, cujus tranquillis silentiis præcelsa Brachmanorum
  ingenia potiuntur; eorumque monitu rationes mundani motus &amp; siderum,
  purosque sacrorum ritus quantum colligere potuit eruditus, ex his quæ
  didicit, aliqua sensibus Magorum infudit; quæ illi cum disciplinis
  præsentiendi futura, per suam quisque progeniem, posteris ætatibus
  tradunt. Ex eo per sæcula multa ad præsens, una eademque prosapia
  multitudo creata, Deorum cultibus dedicatur. Feruntque, si justum est
  credi, etiam ignem c&#339;litus lapsum apud se sempiternis foculis
  custodiri, cujus portionem exiguam ut faustam præisse quondam Asiaticis
  Regibus dicunt: Hujus originis apud veteres numerus erat exilis, ejusque
  mysteriis Persicæ potestates in faciendis rebus divinis solemniter
  utebantur. Eratque piaculum aras adire, vel hostiam contrectare, antequam
  Magus conceptis precationibus libamenta diffunderet præcursoria. Verum
  aucti paullatim, in amplitudinem gentis solidæ concesserunt &amp; nomen:
  villasque inhabitantes nulla murorum firmitudine communitas &amp; legibus
  suis uti permissi, religionis respectu sunt honorati</i>. So this Empire
  was at first composed of many nations, each of which had hitherto its own
  religion: but now <i>Hystaspes</i> and <i>Zoroastres</i> collected what
  they conceived to be best, established it by law, and taught it to
  others, and those to others, 'till their disciples became numerous enough
  for the Priesthood of the whole Empire; and instead of those various old
  religions, they set up their own institutions in the whole Empire, much
  after the manner that <i>Numa</i> contrived and instituted the religion
  of the <i>Romans</i>: and this religion of the <i>Persian</i> Empire was
  composed partly of the institutions of the <i>Chaldæans</i>, in which
  <i>Zoroastres</i> was well skilled; and partly of the institutions of the
  ancient <i>Brachmans</i>, who are supposed to derive even their name from
  the <i>Abrahamans</i>, or sons of <i>Abraham</i>, born of his second wife
  <i>Keturah</i>, instructed by their father in the worship of O<font
  class="sc">NE</font> G<font class="sc">OD</font> without images, and sent
  into the east, where <i>Hystaspes</i> was instructed by their successors.
  About the same time with <i>Hystapes</i> and <i>Zoroastres</i>, lived
  also <i>Ostanes</i>, another eminent <i>Magus</i>: <i>Pliny</i> places
  him under <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>, and <i>Suidas</i> makes him the
  follower of <i>Zoroastres</i>: he came into <i>Greece</i> with
  <i>Xerxes</i>, and seems to be the <i>Otanes</i> of <i>Herodotus</i>, who
  discovered <i>Smerdis</i>, and formed the conspiracy against him, and for
  that service was honoured by the conspirators, and exempt from subjection
  to <i>Darius</i>.</p>

  <p>In the sacred commentary of the <i>Persian</i> rites these words are
  ascribed to <i>Zoroastres</i>; <a name="NtA_484"

  est accipitris capite: hic est primus, incorruptibilis, æternus,
  ingenitus, sine partibus, omnibus aliis dissimillimus, moderator omnis
  boni, donis non capiendus, bonorum optimus, prudentium prudentissimus,
  legum æquitatis ac justitiæ parens, ipse sui doctor, physicus &amp;
  perfectus &amp; sapiens &amp; sacri physici unicus inventor</i>: and the
  same was taught by <i>Ostanes</i>, in his book called <i>Octateuchus</i>.
  This was the Antient God of the <i>Persian Magi</i>, and they worshipped
  him by keeping a perpetual fire for Sacrifices upon an Altar in the
  center of a round area, compassed with a ditch, without any Temple in the
  place, and without paying any worship to the dead, or any images. But in
  a short time they declined from the worship of this Eternal, Invisible
  God, to worship the Sun, and the Fire, and dead men, and images, as the
  <i>Egyptians</i>, <i>Ph&#339;nicians</i>, and <i>Chaldæans</i> had done
  before: and from these superstitions, and the pretending to
  prognostications, the words <i>Magi</i> and <i>Magia</i>, which signify
  the Priests and Religion of the <i>Persians</i>, came to be taken in an
  ill sense.</p>

  <p><i>Darius</i>, or <i>Darab</i>, began his Reign in spring, in the
  sixteenth year of the Empire of the <i>Persians</i>, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 227, and Reigned 36 years, by the unanimous consent of all
  Chronologers. In the second year of his Reign the <i>Jews</i> began to
  build the Temple, by the prophesying of <i>Haggai</i> and
  <i>Zechariah</i>, and finished it in the sixth. He fought the
  <i>Greeks</i> at <i>Marathon</i> in <i>October</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i>
  258, ten years before the battel at <i>Salamis</i>, and died in the fifth
  year following, in the end of winter, or beginning of spring, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 263. The years of <i>Cambyses</i> and <i>Darius</i> are
  determined by three Eclipses of the Moon recorded by <i>Ptolemy</i>, so
  that they cannot be disputed: and by those Eclipses, and the Prophesies
  of <i>Haggai</i> and <i>Zechariah</i> compared together, it is manifest
  that the years of <i>Darius</i> began after the 24th day of the eleventh
  <i>Jewish</i> month, and before the 24th day of <i>April</i>, and by
  consequence in <i>March</i> or <i>April</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Xerxes</i>, <i>Achschirosch</i>, <i>Achsweros</i>, or
  <i>Oxyares</i>, succeeded his father <i>Darius</i>, and spent the first
  five years of his Reign, and something more, in preparations for his
  Expedition against the <i>Greeks</i>: and this Expedition was in the time
  of the Olympic Games, in the beginning of the first year of the 75th
  Olympiad, <i>Callias</i> being <i>Archon</i> at <i>Athens</i>; as all
  Chronologers agree. The great number of people which he drew out of
  <i>Susa</i> to invade <i>Greece</i>, made <i>Æschylus</i> the Poet say <a

  <p>The passage of his army over the <i>Hellespont</i> began in the end of
  the fourth year of the 74th Olympiad, that is in <i>June</i>, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 268, and took up a month; and in autumn, after three months
  more, on the 16th day of the month <i>Munychion</i>, at the full moon,
  was the battel at <i>Salamis</i>; and a little after that an Eclipse of
  the Moon, which by the calculation fell on <i>Octob.</i> 2. His first
  year therefore began in spring, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 263, as above: he
  Reigned almost twenty one years by the consent of all writers, and was
  murdered by <i>Artabanus</i>, captain of his guards; towards the end of
  winter, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 284.</p>

  <p><i>Artabanus</i> Reigned seven months, and upon suspicion of treason
  against <i>Xerxes</i>, was slain by <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>, the son
  of <i>Xerxes</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Artaxerxes</i> began his Reign in the autumnal half year, between
  the 4th and 9th <i>Jewish</i> months, <i>Nehem.</i> i. 1. &amp; ii. 1,
  &amp; v. 14. and <i>Ezra</i> vii. 7, 8, 9. and his 20th year fell in with
  the 4th year of the 83d Olympiad, as <i>Africanus</i> <a name="NtA_486"
  href="#Nt_486"><sup>[486]</sup></a> informs us, and therefore his first
  year began within a month or two or the autumnal Equinox, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 284. <i>Thucydides</i> relates that the news of his death
  came to <i>Athens</i> in winter, in the seventh year of the
  <i>Peloponnesian</i> war, that is <i>An.</i> 4. Olymp. 88. and by the
  Canon he Reigned forty one years, including the Reign of his predecessor
  <i>Artabanus</i>, and died about the middle of winter, <i>Anno
  Nabonass.</i> 325 <i>ineunte</i>: the <i>Persians</i> now call him
  <i>Ardschir</i> and <i>Bahaman</i>, the Oriental Christians
  <i>Artahascht</i>.</p>

  <p>Then Reigned <i>Xerxes</i>, two months, and <i>Sogdian</i> seven
  months, and <i>Darius Nothus</i>, the bastard son of <i>Artaxerxes</i>,
  nineteen years wanting four or five months; and <i>Darius</i> died in
  summer, a little after the end of the <i>Peloponnesian</i> war, and in
  the same Olympic year, and by consequence in <i>May</i> or <i>June</i>,
  <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 344. The 13th year of his Reign was coincident in
  winter with the 20th of the <i>Peloponnesian</i> war, and the years of
  that war are stated by indisputable characters, and agreed on by all
  Chronologers: the war began in spring, <i>Ann.</i> 1. Olymp. 87, lasted
  27 years, and ended <i>Apr.</i> 14. <i>An.</i> 4. Olymp. 93.</p>

  <p>The next King was <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i>, the son of <i>Darius</i>:
  he Reigned forty six years, and died <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 390. Then
  Reigned <i>Artaxerxes Ochus</i> twenty one years; <i>Arses</i>, or
  <i>Arogus</i>, two years, and <i>Darius Codomannus</i> four years, unto
  the battel of <i>Arbela</i>, whereby the <i>Persian</i> Monarchy was
  translated to the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Octob.</i> 2. <i>An. Nabonass.</i>
  417; but <i>Darius</i> was not slain untill a year and some months
  after.</p>

  <p>I have hitherto stated the times of this Monarchy out of the
  <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> writers: for the <i>Jews</i> knew nothing
  more of the <i>Babylonian</i> and <i>Medo-Persian</i> Empires than what
  they have out of the sacred books of the old Testament; and therefore own
  no more Kings, nor years of Kings, than they can find in those books: the
  Kings they reckon are only <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, <i>Evilmerodach</i>,
  <i>Belshazzar</i>, <i>Darius</i> the <i>Mede</i>, <i>Cyrus</i>,
  <i>Ahasuerus</i>, and <i>Darius</i> the <i>Persian</i>; this last
  <i>Darius</i> they reckon to be the <i>Artaxerxes</i>, in whose Reign
  <i>Ezra</i> and <i>Nehemiah</i> came to <i>Jerusalem</i>, accounting
  <i>Artaxerxes</i> a common name of the <i>Persian</i> Kings:
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, they say, Reigned forty five years, 2 <i>King.</i>
  xxv. 27. <i>Belshazzar</i> three years, <i>Dan.</i> viii. 1. and
  therefore <i>Evilmerodach</i> twenty three, to make up the seventy years
  captivity; excluding the first year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, in which
  they say the Prophesy of the seventy years was given. To <i>Darius</i>
  the <i>Mede</i> they assign one year, or at most but two, <i>Dan.</i> ix.
  1. to <i>Cyrus</i> three years incomplete, <i>Dan.</i> x. 1. to
  <i>Ahasuerus</i> twelve years 'till the casting of <i>Pur</i>,
  <i>Esth.</i> iii. 7. one year more 'till the <i>Jews</i> smote their
  enemies, <i>Esth.</i> ix. 1. and one year more 'till <i>Esther</i> and
  <i>Mordecai</i> wrote the second letter for the keeping of <i>Purim</i>,
  <i>Esth.</i> ix. 29. in all fourteen years: and to <i>Darius</i> the
  <i>Persian</i> they allot thirty two or rather thirty six years,
  <i>Nehem.</i> xiii. 6. So that the <i>Persian</i> Empire from the
  building of the Temple in the Second year of <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>,
  flourished only thirty four years, until <i>Alexander</i> the great
  overthrew it: thus the <i>Jews</i> reckon in their greater Chronicle,
  <i>Seder Olam Rabbah</i>. <i>Josephus</i>, out of the sacred and other
  books, reckons only these Kings of <i>Persia</i>; <i>Cyrus</i>,
  <i>Cambyses</i>, <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>, <i>Xerxes</i>,
  <i>Artaxerxes</i>, and <i>Darius</i>: and taking this <i>Darius</i>, who
  was <i>Darius Nothus</i>, to be one and the same King with the last
  <i>Darius</i>, whom <i>Alexander</i> the great overcame; by means of this
  reckoning he makes <i>Sanballat</i> and <i>Jaddua</i> alive when
  <i>Alexander</i> the great overthrew the <i>Persian</i> Empire. Thus all
  the <i>Jews</i> conclude the <i>Persian</i> Empire with <i>Artaxerxes
  Longimanus</i>, and <i>Darius Nothus</i>, allowing no more Kings of
  <i>Persia</i>, than they found in the books of <i>Ezra</i> and
  <i>Nehemiah</i>; and referring to the Reigns of this <i>Artaxerxes</i>,
  and this <i>Darius</i>, whatever they met with in profane history
  concerning the following Kings of the same names: so as to take
  <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>, <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i> and <i>Artaxerxes
  Ochus</i>, for one and the same <i>Artaxerxes</i>; and <i>Darius
  Nothus</i>, and <i>Darius Codomannus</i>, for one and the same
  <i>Darius</i>; and <i>Jaddua</i>, and <i>Simeon Justus</i>, for one and
  the same High-Priest. Those <i>Jews</i> who took <i>Herod</i> for the
  <i>Messiah</i>, and were thence called <i>Herodians</i>, seem to have
  grounded their opinion upon the seventy weeks of years, which they found
  between the Reign of <i>Cyrus</i> and that of <i>Herod</i>: but
  afterwards, in applying the Prophesy to <i>Theudas</i>, and <i>Judas</i>
  of <i>Galilee</i>, and at length to <i>Barchochab</i>, they seem to have
  shortned the Reign of the Kingdom of <i>Persia</i>. These accounts being
  very imperfect, it was necessary to have recourse to the records of the
  <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latines</i>, and to the Canon recited by
  <i>Ptolemy</i>, for stating the times of this Empire. Which being done,
  we have a better ground for understanding the history of the <i>Jews</i>
  set down in the books of <i>Ezra</i> and <i>Nehemiah</i>, and adjusting
  it; for this history having suffered by time, wants some illustration:
  and first I shall state the history of the <i>Jews</i> under
  <i>Zerubbabel</i>, in the Reigns of <i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Cambysis</i>, and
  <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>.</p>

  <p>This history is contained partly in the three first chapters of the
  book of <i>Ezra</i>, and first five verses of the fourth; and partly in
  the book of <i>Nehemiah</i>, from the 5th verse of the seventh chapter to
  the 9th verse of the twelfth: for <i>Nehemiah</i> copied all this out of
  the Chronicles of the <i>Jews</i>, written before his days; as may appear
  by reading the place, and considering that the Priests and Levites who
  sealed the Covenant on the 24th day of the seventh month, <i>Nehem.</i>
  x. were the very same with those who returned from captivity in the first
  year of <i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Nehem.</i> xii. and that all those who returned
  sealed it: this will be perceived by the following comparison of their
  names.</p>

  <p>The <i>Levites</i>, <i>Jeshua</i>, <i>Kadmiel</i>, and <i>Hodaviah</i>

  <p>Comparing therefore the books of <i>Ezra</i> and <i>Nehemiah</i>
  together; the history of the <i>Jews</i> under <i>Cyrus</i>,
  <i>Cambyses</i>, and <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>, is that they returned from
  captivity under <i>Zerubbabel</i>, in the first year of <i>Cyrus</i>,
  with the Holy Vessels and a commission to build the Temple; and came to
  <i>Jerusalem</i> and <i>Judah</i>, every one to his city, and dwelt in
  their cities untill the seventh month; and then coming to
  <i>Jerusalem</i>, they first built the Altar, and on the first day of the
  seventh month began to offer the daily burnt-offerings, and read in the
  book of the Law, and they kept a solemn fast, and sealed a Covenant; and
  thenceforward the Rulers of the people dwelt at <i>Jerusalem</i>, and the
  rest of the people cast lots, to dwell one in ten at <i>Jerusalem</i>,
  and the rest in the cities of <i>Judah</i>: and in the second year of
  their coming, in the second month, which was six years before the death
  of <i>Cyrus</i>, they laid the foundation of the Temple; but <i>the
  adversaries of </i>Judah<i> troubled them in building, and hired
  counsellors against them all the days of </i>Cyrus, and longer, <i>even
  until the Reign of </i>Darius<i> King of </i>Persia: but in the second
  year of his Reign, by the prophesying of <i>Haggai</i> and
  <i>Zechariah</i>, they returned to the work; and by the help of a new
  decree from <i>Darius</i>, finished it on the third day of the month
  <i>Adar</i>, in the sixth year of his Reign, and kept the Dedication with
  joy, and the Passover, and Feast of Unleavened Bread.</p>

  <p>Now this <i>Darius</i> was not <i>Darius Nothus</i>, but <i>Darius
  Hystaspis</i>, as I gather by considering that the second year of this
  <i>Darius</i> was the seventieth of the indignation against
  <i>Jerusalem</i>, and the cities of <i>Judah</i>, which indignation
  commenced with the invasion of <i>Jerusalem</i>, and the cities of
  <i>Judah</i> by <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, in the ninth year of
  <i>Zedekiah</i>, <i>Zech.</i> i. 12. <i>Jer.</i> xxxiv. 1, 7, 22. &amp;
  xxxix. 1. and that the fourth year of this <i>Darius</i>, was the
  seventieth from the burning of the Temple in the eleventh year of
  <i>Zedekiah</i>, <i>Zech.</i> vii. 5. &amp; <i>Jer.</i> lii. 12. both
  which are exactly true of <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>: and that in the second
  year of this <i>Darius</i> there were men living who had seen the first
  Temple, <i>Hagg.</i> ii. 3. whereas the second year of <i>Darius
  Nothus</i> was 166 years after the desolation of the Temple and City. And
  further, if the finishing of the Temple be deferred to the sixth year of
  <i>Darius Nothus</i>, <i>Jeshua</i> and <i>Zerubbabel</i> must have been
  the one High-Priest, the other Captain of the people an hundred and
  eighteen years together, besides their ages before; which is surely too
  long: for in the first year of <i>Cyrus</i> the chief Priests were
  <i>Serajah</i>, <i>Jeremiah</i>, <i>Ezra</i>, <i>Amariah</i>,
  <i>Malluch</i>, <i>Shechaniah</i>, <i>Rehum</i>, <i>Meremoth</i>,
  <i>Iddo</i>, <i>Ginnetho</i>, <i>Abijah</i>, <i>Miamin</i>,
  <i>Maadiah</i>, <i>Bilgah</i>, <i>Shemajah</i>, <i>Joiarib</i>,
  <i>Jedaiah</i>, <i>Sallu</i>, <i>Amok</i>, <i>Hilkiah</i>,
  <i>Jedaiah</i>: these were Priests in the days of <i>Jeshua</i>, and the
  eldest sons of them all, <i>Merajah</i> the son of <i>Serajah</i>,
  <i>Hananiah</i> the son of <i>Jeremiah</i>, <i>Meshullam</i> the son of
  <i>Ezra</i>, &amp;c. were chief Priests in the days of <i>Joiakim</i> the
  son of <i>Jeshua</i>: <i>Nehem.</i> xii. and therefore the High
  Priest-hood of <i>Jeshua</i> was but of an ordinary length.</p>

  <p>I have now stated the history of the <i>Jews</i> in the Reigns of
  <i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Cambyses</i>, and <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>: it remains
  that I state their history in the Reigns of <i>Xerxes</i>, and
  <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>: for I place the history of <i>Ezra</i> and
  <i>Nehemiah</i> in the Reign of this <i>Artaxerxes</i>, and not in that
  of <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i>: for during all the <i>Persian</i> Monarchy,
  until the last <i>Darius</i> mentioned in Scripture, whom I take to be
  <i>Darius Nothus</i>, there were but six High-Priests in continual
  succession of father and son, namely, <i>Jeshua</i>, <i>Joiakim</i>,
  <i>Eliashib</i>, <i>Joiada</i>, <i>Jonathan</i>, <i>Jaddua</i>, and the
  seventh High-Priest was <i>Onias</i> the son of <i>Jaddua</i>, and the
  eighth was <i>Simeon Justus</i>, the Son of <i>Onias</i>, and the ninth
  was <i>Eleazar</i> the younger brother of <i>Simeon</i>. Now, at a mean
  reckoning, we should allow about 27 or 28 years only to a Generation by
  the eldest sons of a family, one Generation with another, as above; but
  if in this case we allow 30 years to a Generation, and may further
  suppose that <i>Jeshua</i>, at the return of the captivity in the first
  year of the Empire of the <i>Persians</i>, was about 30 or 40 years old;
  <i>Joiakim</i> will be of about that age in the 16th year of <i>Darius
  Hystaspis</i>, <i>Eliashib</i> in the tenth year of <i>Xerxes</i>,
  <i>Joiada</i> in the 19th year of <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>,
  <i>Jonathan</i> in the 8th year of <i>Darius Nothus</i>, <i>Jaddua</i> in
  the 19th year of <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i>, <i>Onias</i> in the 3d year of
  <i>Artaxerxes Ochus</i>, and <i>Simeon Justus</i> two years before the
  death of <i>Alexander</i> the Great: and this reckoning, as it is
  according to the course of nature, so it agrees perfectly well with
  history; for thus <i>Eliashib</i> might be High-Priest, and have
  grandsons, before the seventh year of <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>,
  <i>Ezra</i> x. 6. and without exceeding the age which many old men attain
  unto, continue High-Priest 'till after the 32d year of that King,
  <i>Nehem.</i> xiii. 6, 7. and his grandson <i>Johanan</i>, or
  <i>Jonathan</i>, might have a chamber in the Temple in the seventh year
  of that King, <i>Ezra</i> x. 6. and be High-Priest before <i>Ezra</i>
  wrote the sons of <i>Levi</i> in the book of <i>Chronicles</i>;
  <i>Nehem.</i> xii. 23. and in his High-Priesthood, he might slay his
  younger brother <i>Jesus</i> in the Temple, before the end of the Reign
  of <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i>: <i>Joseph. Antiq.</i> l. xi. c. 7. and
  <i>Jaddua</i> might be High-Priest before the death of <i>Sanballat</i>,
  <i>Joseph.</i> <i>ib.</i> and before the death of <i>Nehemiah</i>,
  <i>Nehem.</i> xii. 22. and also before the end of the Reign of <i>Darius
  Nothus</i>; and he might thereby give occasion to <i>Josephus</i> and the
  later <i>Jews</i>, who took this King for the last <i>Darius</i>, to fall
  into an opinion that <i>Sanballat, Jaddua</i>, and <i>Manasseh</i> the
  younger brother of <i>Jaddua</i>, lived till the end of the Reign of the
  last <i>Darius</i>: <i>Joseph.</i> <i>Antiq.</i> l. xi. c. 7, 8. and the
  said <i>Manasseh</i> might marry <i>Nicaso</i> the daughter of
  <i>Sanballat</i>, and for that offence be chased from <i>Nehemiah</i>,
  before the end of the Reign of <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>;
  <i>Nehem</i>. xiii. 28. <i>Joseph.</i> <i>Antiq.</i> l. xi. c. 7, 8. and
  <i>Sanballat</i> might at that time be <i>Satrapa</i> of <i>Samaria</i>,
  and in the Reign of <i>Darius Nothus</i>, or soon after, build the Temple
  of the <i>Samaritans</i> in <i>Mount Gerizim</i>, for his son-in-law
  <i>Manasseh</i>, the first High-Priest of that Temple; <i>Joseph.</i>
  <i>ib.</i> and <i>Simeon Justus</i> might be High-Priest when the
  <i>Persian</i> Empire was invaded by <i>Alexander</i> the Great, as the
  <i>Jews</i> represent, <i>Joma</i> fol. 69. 1. <i>Liber Juchasis. R.
  Gedaliah</i>, &amp;c. and for that reason he might be taken by some of
  the <i>Jews</i> for the same High-Priest with <i>Jaddua</i>, and be dead
  some time before the book of <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> was writ in
  <i>Hebrew</i> at <i>Jerusalem</i>, by the grandfather of him, who in the
  38th year of the <i>Egyptian</i> Æra of <i>Dionysius</i>, that is in the
  77th year after the death of <i>Alexander</i> the Great, met with a copy
  of it in <i>Egypt</i>, and there translated it into <i>Greek:
  Ecclesiast.</i> ch. 50. &amp; <i>in Prolog.</i> and <i>Eleazar</i>, the
  younger brother and successor of <i>Simeon</i>, might cause the Law to be
  translated into <i>Greek</i>, in the beginning of the Reign of
  <i>Ptolemaus Philadelphus</i>: <i>Joseph.</i> <i>Antiq.</i> l. xii. c. 2.
  and <i>Onias</i> the son of <i>Simeon Justus</i>, who was a child at his
  father's death, and by consequence was born in his father's old age,
  might be so old in the Reign of <i>Ptolemæus Euergetes</i>, as to have
  his follies excused to that King, by representing that he was then grown
  childish with old age. <i>Joseph.</i> <i>Antiq.</i> l. xii. c. 4. In this
  manner the actions of all these High-Priests suit with the Reigns of the
  Kings, without any straining from the course of nature: and according to
  this reckoning the days of <i>Ezra</i> and <i>Nehemiah</i> fall in with
  the Reign of the first <i>Artaxerxes</i>; for <i>Ezra</i> and
  <i>Nehemiah</i> flourished in the High Priesthood of <i>Eliashib</i>,
  <i>Ezra</i> x. 6. <i>Nehem.</i> iii. 1. &amp; xiii. 4, 28. But if
  <i>Eliashib</i>, <i>Ezra</i> and <i>Nehemiah</i> be placed in the Reign
  of the second <i>Artaxerxes</i>, since they lived beyond the 32d year of
  <i>Artaxerxes</i>, <i>Nehem.</i> xiii. 28, there must be at least 160
  years allotted to the three first High-Priests, and but 42 to the four or
  five last, a division too unequal: for the High Priesthoods of
  <i>Jeshua</i>, <i>Joiakim</i>, and <i>Eliashib</i>, were but of an
  ordinary length, that of <i>Jeshua</i> fell in with one Generation of the
  chief Priests, and that of <i>Joiakim</i> with the next Generation, as we
  have shewed already; and that of <i>Eliashib</i> fell in with the third
  Generation: for at the dedication of the wall, <i>Zechariah</i> the son
  of <i>Jonathan</i>, the son of <i>Shemaiah</i>, was one of the Priests,
  <i>Nehem.</i> xii. 35, and <i>Jonathan</i> and his father
  <i>Shemaiah</i>, were contemporaries to <i>Joiakim</i> and his father
  <i>Jeshua</i>: <i>Nehem.</i> xii. 6, 18. I observe further that in the
  first year of <i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Jeshua</i>, and <i>Bani</i>, or
  <i>Binnui</i>, were chief fathers of the <i>Levites</i>, <i>Nehem</i>.
  vii. 7. 15. &amp; <i>Ezra</i> ii. 2. 10. &amp; iii. 9. and that
  <i>Jozabad</i> the son of <i>Jeshua</i>, and <i>Noadiah</i> the son of
  <i>Binnui</i>, were chief Levites in the seventh year of
  <i>Artaxerxes</i>, when <i>Ezra</i> came to <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>Ezra</i>
  viii. 33. so that this <i>Artaxerxes</i> began his Reign before the end
  of the second Generation: and that he Reigned in the time of the third
  Generation is confirmed by two instances more; for <i>Meshullam</i> the
  son of <i>Berechiah</i>, the son of <i>Meshezabeel</i>, and
  <i>Azariah</i> the son of <i>Maaseiah</i>, the son of <i>Ananiah</i>,
  were fathers of their houses at the repairing of the wall; <i>Nehem.</i>
  iii. 4, 23. and their grandfathers, <i>Meshazabeel</i> and
  <i>Hananiah</i>, subscribed the covenant in the Reign of <i>Cyrus</i>:
  <i>Nehem.</i> x. 21, 23. Yea <i>Nehemiah</i>, this same <i>Nehemiah</i>
  the son of <i>Hachaliah</i>, was the <i>Tirshatha</i>, and subscribed it,
  <i>Nehem.</i> x. 1, &amp; viii. 9, &amp; <i>Ezra</i> ii. 2, 63. and
  therefore in the 32d year of <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i>, he will be above
  180 years old, an age surely too great. The same may be said of
  <i>Ezra</i>, if he was that Priest and Scribe who read the Law,
  <i>Nehem.</i> viii. for he is the son of <i>Serajah</i>, the son of
  <i>Azariah</i>, the son of <i>Hilkiah</i>, the son of <i>Shallum</i>,
  &amp;c. <i>Ezra</i> vii. 1. and this <i>Serajah</i> went into captivity
  at the burning of the Temple, and was there slain, 1 <i>Chron.</i> vi.
  14. 2 <i>King.</i> xxv. 18. and from his death, to the twentieth year of
  <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i>, is above 200 years; an age too great for
  <i>Ezra</i>.</p>

  <p>I consider further that <i>Ezra</i>, chap. iv. names <i>Cyrus</i>, *,
  <i>Darius</i>, <i>Ahasuerus</i>, and <i>Artaxerxes</i>, in continual
  order, as successors to one another, and these names agree to
  <i>Cyrus</i>, *, <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>, <i>Xerxes</i>, and
  <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>, and to no other Kings of <i>Persia</i>:
  some take this <i>Artaxerxes</i> to be not the Successor, but the
  Predecessor of <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>, not considering that in his Reign
  the <i>Jews</i> were busy in building the City and the Wall, <i>Ezra</i>
  iv. 12. and by consequence had finished the Temple before. <i>Ezra</i>
  describes first how the people of the land hindered the building of the
  Temple all the days of <i>Cyrus</i>, and further, untill the Reign of
  <i>Darius</i>; and after the Temple was built, how they hindered the
  building of the city in the Reign of <i>Ahasuerus</i> and
  <i>Artaxerxes</i>, and then returns back to the story of the Temple in
  the Reign of <i>Cyrus</i> and <i>Darius</i>; and this is confirmed by
  comparing the book of <i>Ezra</i> with the book of <i>Esdras</i>: for if
  in the book of <i>Ezra</i> you omit the story of <i>Ahasuerus</i> and
  <i>Artaxerxes</i>, and in that of <i>Esdras</i> you omit the same story
  of <i>Artaxerxes</i>, and that of the three wise men, the two books will
  agree: and therefore the book of <i>Esdras</i>, if you except the story
  of the three wise men, was originally copied from authentic writings of
  Sacred Authority. Now the story of <i>Artaxerxes</i>, which, with that of
  <i>Ahasuerus</i>, in the book of <i>Ezra</i> interrupts the story of
  <i>Darius</i>, doth not interrupt it in the book of <i>Esdras</i>, but is
  there inferred into the story of <i>Cyrus</i>, between the first and
  second chapter of <i>Ezra</i>; and all the rest of the story of
  <i>Cyrus</i>, and that of <i>Darius</i>, is told in the book of
  <i>Esdras</i> in continual order, without any interruption: so that the
  <i>Darius</i> which in the book of <i>Ezra</i> precedes <i>Ahasuerus</i>
  and <i>Artaxerxes</i>, and the <i>Darius</i> which in the same book
  follows them, is, by the book of <i>Esdras</i>, one and the same
  <i>Darius</i>; and I take the book of <i>Esdras</i> to be the best
  interpreter of the book of <i>Ezra</i>: so the <i>Darius</i> mentioned
  between <i>Cyrus</i> and <i>Ahasuerus</i>, is <i>Darius Hysaspis</i>; and
  therefore <i>Ahasuerus</i> and <i>Artaxerxes</i> who succeed him, are
  <i>Xerxes</i> and <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>; and the <i>Jews</i> who
  came up from <i>Artaxerxes</i> to <i>Jerusalem</i>, and began to build
  the city and the wall, <i>Ezra</i> iv. 13. are <i>Ezra</i> with his
  companions: which being understood, the history of the <i>Jews</i> in the
  Reign of these Kings will be as follows.</p>

  <p>After the Temple was built, and <i>Darius Hystaspis</i> was dead, the
  enemies of the <i>Jews</i> in the beginning of the Reign of his successor
  <i>Ahasuerus</i> or <i>Xerxes</i>, wrote unto him an accusation against
  them; <i>Ezra</i> iv. 6. but in the seventh year of his successor
  <i>Artaxerxes</i>, <i>Ezra</i> and his companions went up from
  <i>Babylon</i> with Offerings and Vessels for the Temple, and power to
  bestow on it out of the King's Treasure what should be requisite;
  <i>Ezra</i> vii. whence the Temple is said to be finished, <i>according
  to the commandment of </i>Cyrus<i>, and </i>Darius<i>, and
  </i>Artaxerxes<i> King of </i>Persia: <i>Ezra</i> vi. 14. Their
  commission was also to set Magistrates and Judges over the land, and
  thereby becoming a new Body Politic, they called a great Council or
  Sanhedrim to separate the people from strange wives; and they were also
  encouraged to attempt the building of <i>Jerusalem</i> with its wall: and
  thence <i>Ezra</i> saith in his prayer, that <i>God had extended mercy
  unto them in the sight of the Kings of </i>Persia<i>, and given them a
  reviving to set up the house of their God, and to repair the desolations
  thereof, and to give them a WALL in </i>Judah<i>, even in </i>Jerusalem.
  <i>Ezra</i> ix. 9. But when they had begun to repair the wall, their
  enemies wrote against them to <i>Artaxerxes</i>: <i>Be it known</i>, say
  they, <i>unto the King, that the </i>Jews<i> which came up from thee to
  us, are come unto </i>Jerusalem<i>, building the rebellious and the bad
  city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations</i>,
  &amp;c. And the King wrote back that the <i>Jews</i> should cease and the
  city not be built, until another commandment should be given from him:
  whereupon their enemies <i>went up to </i>Jerusalem<i>, and made them
  cease by force and power</i>; <i>Ezra</i> iv. but in the twentieth year
  of the King, <i>Nehemiah</i> hearing that the <i>Jews</i> were in great
  affliction and distress, and that the wall of <i>Jerusalem</i>, that wall
  which had been newly repaired by <i>Ezra</i>, <i>was broken down, and the
  gates thereof burnt wth fire</i>; he obtained leave of the King to go and
  build the city, and the Governour's house, <i>Nehem.</i> i. 3. &amp; ii.
  6, 8, 17. and coming to <i>Jerusalem</i> the same year, he continued
  Governor twelve years, and built the wall; and being opposed by
  <i>Sanballat</i>, <i>Tobiah</i> and <i>Geshem</i>, he persisted in the
  work with great resolution and patience, until the breaches were made up:
  then <i>Sanballat</i> and <i>Geshem</i> sent messengers unto him five
  times to hinder him from setting up the doors upon the gates: but
  notwithstanding he persisted in the work, until the doors were also set
  up: so the wall was finished in the eight and twentieth year of the King,
  <i>Joseph.</i> <i>Antiq.</i> l. xi. c. 5. in the five and twentieth day
  of the month <i>Elul</i>, or sixth month, in fifty and two days after the
  breaches were made up, and they began to work upon the gates. While the
  timber for the gates was preparing and seasoning, they made up the
  breaches of the wall; both were works of time, and are not jointly to be
  reckoned within the 52 days: this is the time of the last work of the
  wall, the work of setting up the gates after the timber was seasoned and
  the breaches made up. When he had set up the gates, he dedicated the wall
  with great solemnity, and appointed Officers <i>over the chambers for the
  Treasure, for the Offerings, for the First-Fruits, and for the Tithes, to
  gather into them out of the fields of the cities, the portions appointed
  by the law for the Priests and Levites; and the Singers and the Porters
  kept the ward of their God</i>; Nehem. xii. <i>but the people in the city
  were but few, and the houses were unbuilt</i>: <i>Nehem.</i> vii. 1, 4.
  and in this condition he left <i>Jerusalem</i> in the 32d year of the
  King; and after sometime returning back from the King, he reformed such
  abuses as had been committed in his absence. <i>Nehem.</i> xiii. In the
  mean time, the Genealogies of the Priests and Levites were recorded in
  the book of the <i>Chronicles</i>, in the days of <i>Eliashib</i>,
  <i>Joiada</i>, <i>Jonathan</i>, and <i>Jaddua</i>, until the Reign of the
  next King <i>Darius Nothus</i>, whom <i>Nehemiah</i> calls <i>Darius</i>
  the <i>Persian</i>: <i>Nehem.</i> xii. 11, 22, 23. whence it follows that
  <i>Nehemiah</i> was Governor of the <i>Jews</i> until the Reign of
  <i>Darius Nothus</i>. And here ends the Sacred History of the
  <i>Jews</i>.</p>

  <p>The histories of the <i>Persians</i> now extant in the East, represent
  that the oldest Dynasties of the Kings of <i>Persia</i>, were those whom
  they call <i>Pischdadians</i> and <i>Kaianides</i>, and that the Dynasty
  of the <i>Kaianides</i> immediately succeeded that of the
  <i>Pischdadians</i>. They derive the name <i>Kaianides</i> from the word
  <i>Kai</i>, which, they say, in the old <i>Persian</i> language signified
  a Giant or great King; and they call the first four Kings of this
  Dynasty, <i>Kai-Cobad, Kai-Caus, Kai-Cosroes</i>, and <i>Lohorasp</i>,
  and by <i>Lohorasp</i> mean <i>Kai-Axeres</i>, or <i>Cyaxeres</i>: for
  they say that <i>Lohorasp</i> was the first of their Kings who reduced
  their armies to good order and discipline, and <i>Herodotus</i> affirms
  the same thing of <i>Cyaxeres</i>: and they say further, that
  <i>Lohorasp</i> went eastward, and conquered many Provinces of
  <i>Persia</i>, and that one of his Generals, whom the <i>Hebrews</i> call
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, the <i>Arabians</i> <i>Bocktanassar</i>, and
  others <i>Raham</i> and <i>Gudars</i>, went westward, and conquered all
  <i>Syria</i> and <i>Judæa</i>, and took the city of <i>Jerusalem</i> and
  destroyed it: they seem to call <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> the General of
  <i>Lohorasp</i>, because he assisted him in some of his wars. The fifth
  King of this Dynasty, they call <i>Kischtasp</i>, and by this name mean
  sometimes <i>Darius Medus</i>, and sometimes <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>: for
  they say that he was contemporary to <i>Ozair</i> or <i>Ezra</i>, and to
  <i>Zaradust</i> or <i>Zoroastres</i>, the Legislator of the
  <i>Ghebers</i> or fire-worshippers, and established his doctrines
  throughout all <i>Persia</i>; and here they take him for <i>Darius
  Hystaspis</i>: they say also that he was contemporary to <i>Jeremiah</i>,
  and to <i>Daniel</i>, and that he was the son and successor of
  <i>Lohorasp</i>, and here they take him for <i>Darius</i> the
  <i>Mede</i>. The sixth King of the <i>Kaianides</i>, they call
  <i>Bahaman</i>, and tell us that <i>Bahaman</i> was <i>Ardschir
  Diraz</i>, that is <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>, so called from the great
  extent of his power: and yet they say that <i>Bahaman</i> went westward
  into <i>Mesopotamia</i> and <i>Syria</i>, and conquered <i>Belshazzar</i>
  the son of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, and gave the Kingdom to <i>Cyrus</i>
  his Lieutenant-General over <i>Media</i>: and here they take
  <i>Bahaman</i> for <i>Darius Medus</i>. Next after <i>Ardschir Diraz</i>,
  they place <i>Homai</i> a Queen, the mother of <i>Darius Nothus</i>, tho'
  really she did not Reign: and the two next and last Kings of the
  <i>Kaianides</i>, they call <i>Darab</i> the bastard son of <i>Ardschir
  Diraz</i>, and <i>Darab</i> who was conquered by <i>Ascander Roumi</i>,
  that is <i>Darius Nothus</i>, and <i>Darius</i> who was conquered by
  <i>Alexander</i> the <i>Greek</i>: and the Kings between these two
  <i>Darius's</i> they omit, as they do also <i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Cambyses</i>,
  and <i>Xerxes</i>. The Dynasty of the <i>Kaianides</i>, was therefore
  that of the <i>Medes</i> and <i>Persians</i>, beginning with the
  defection of the <i>Medes</i> from the <i>Assyrians</i>, in the end of
  the Reign of <i>Sennacherib</i>, and ending with the conquest of
  <i>Persia</i> by <i>Alexander</i> the Great. But their account of this
  Dynasty is very imperfect, some Kings being omitted, and others being
  confounded with one another: and their Chronology of this Dynasty is
  still worse; for to the first King they assign a Reign of 120 years, to
  the second a Reign of 150 years, to the third a Reign of 60 years, to the
  fourth a Reign of 120 years, to the fifth as much, and to the sixth a
  Reign of 112 years.</p>

  <p>This Dynasty being the Monarchy of the <i>Medes</i>, and
  <i>Persians</i>; the Dynasty of the <i>Pischdadians</i> which immediately
  preceded it, must be that of the <i>Assyrians</i>: and according to the
  oriental historians this was the oldest Kingdom in the world, some of its
  Kings living a thousand years a-piece, and one of them Reigning five
  hundred years, another seven hundred years, and another a thousand
  years.</p>

  <p>We need not then wonder, that the <i>Egyptians</i> have made the Kings
  in the first Dynasty of their Monarchy, that which was seated at
  <i>Thebes</i> in the days of <i>David</i>, <i>Solomon</i>, and
  <i>Rehoboam</i>, so very ancient and so long lived; since the
  <i>Persians</i> have done the like to their Kings, who began to Reign in
  <i>Assyria</i> two hundred years after the death of <i>Solomon</i>; and
  the <i>Syrians</i> of <i>Damascus</i> have done the like to their Kings
  <i>Adar</i> and <i>Hazael</i>, who Reigned an hundred years after the
  death of <i>Solomon</i>, <i>worshipping them as Gods, and boasting their
  antiquity, and not knowing</i>, saith <i>Josephus</i>, <i>that they were
  but modern</i>.</p>

  <p>And whilst all these nations have magnified their Antiquities so
  exceedingly, we need not wonder that the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latines</i>
  have made their first Kings a little older than the truth.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
